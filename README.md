This project will guide you on how to create a model and predict YouTube views for a video that does not already exist on YouTube.

In here datasets are used from the kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

To getting up and running the Dataset_Creation.ipynb file you have to download USVideos.csv file from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=USvideos.csv and add it to the datasets folder.
