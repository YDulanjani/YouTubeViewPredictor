But the plan still needs to pass the House, where it's already facing strong headwinds.\nThe deal would boost military and non-defense spending by $300 billion over the next two years as well as and more than $80 billion in disaster relief. About $160 billion would go to the Pentagon and about $128 billion would to non-defense programs. The agreement includes spending on a variety of other needs, including disaster aid to respond to recent natural disasters.

You just get a jump on the day. The reason I wake up at 4:30 in the morning is because no one else is awake yet, so that gives me the opportunity to do things that I need to get done, kinda selfishly for myself, and the big one in that category is working out. And it doesn't feel good at 4:30 when you get up, but by the time 7 o'clock rolls around, and you've already worked out, and you've already got some work done, and you've got some time to say goodbye to your kids before they go to school? It's infinitely better than sleeping in until 6:45, and you get out of bed, and now you've missed your kids going to school, or whatever. You're not prepared for the day, it's awful.Feloni: So if someone, maybe they don't have time to work out or they just need something that could be like a quick fix, is there something that you recommend?Willink: Oh yeah, workouts don't have to take a long time. Workouts can be very quick. Matter of fact, go do two minutes of burpees, as many burpees as you can, in two minutes, or four minutes, or six minutes, go and sprint, go and do anything very intensely, for a short period of time and you'll get great benefit out of it.Feloni: Something I'm sure you hear a lot is 4:30, like this either just can't fit into my schedule, or if I'm gonna be realistic, I'm probably not gonna wake up at 4:30, what do you tell people who say that?Willink: Yeah, and there's people that work night shifts, and there's people that it's unhealthy for them, they can't fall as-- it's like no, be healthy, get enough sleep, but, first of all, wake up at the same time every day and, if you pick that time and you start waking up at the same time every day, that's very good for you. It doesn't have to be 4:30, it could be 6:30, it could be 7, I don't know what your personal schedule is, but find out a time, pick it, set it, stick to it, and maintain that schedule, and that's gonna end up better for you.I recommend it's earlier. I recommend that you go to bed earlier, 'cause what are you doing at night, most of the time? Most of the time at night, you're not working on anything super productive, you're just winding down and watching stupid YouTube videos, or surfing the internet, reading clickbait stories, right? Don't do that, instead, go to sleep, and then wake up early.Feloni: Could you explain that notion of discipline equals freedom?Willink: If you want more freedom in your life, you have to have more discipline. If you don't have any discipline, you'll end up with absolutely no freedom, you'll end up being a slave to other people that boss you around. There's all kind of problems that can occur, if you don't have discipline in your life. And the more discipline you have, the more freedom you're gonna have.Feloni: So just the discipline of the Seals, will never-- it's impossible to leave?Willink: No, it's possible to leave, there's retired seals all over the place that are undisciplined. They've moved on, and they don't care about that anymore. It's fine, I don't judge other people on what they're doin', like they're probably stoked to sleep in and hang out with their kids, and eat breakfast in bed, that's fine. I don't have anything against that. But for me? I wanna get up and go.

While Britain created the immortal Spitfire, Lancaster and Edgley Optica, it also created a wealth of dangerous, disgraceful and diabolical designs. These are just ten plucked from a shortlist of thirty.  In defining ‘worst’- we’ve looked for one, or a combination, of the following: design flaws, conceptual mistakes, being extremely dangerous, being unpleasant to fly, or obsolete at the point of service entry (and the type must have entered service). Grab a cup of tea, and prepare for ire as you read about ten machines they wanted your dad, grandad or great grandad to fly to war. I'd love to hear your opinions below.

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends.

As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together—to the very ends of the Earth—to protect everything they’ve grown to treasure.For How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, series director Dean DeBlois returns alongside the all-star cast.

This is a historic win as Peele is the first black writer to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIn Get Out, photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is nervous about meeting his girlfriend Rose's parents for the first time, especially when he learns that she has not told them that he is black. Their awkward behavior, along with the oddness exhibited by their two African-American servants, puts Chris on alert but even so, he is unprepared for the family's true motivations.\n\nWatch the trailer on Oscar.com here: http://oscar.go.com/video/best-actor-nominees/get-out-trailer\n\nFor more Oscars highlights and can't miss moments visit Oscar.com:\nAcceptance Speeches & Interviews: http://oscar.go.com/video \nRed Carpet Galleries: http://oscar.go.com/red-carpet\nWinners: http://oscar.go.com/winners  oscars|""academy""|""awards""|""statue""|""ceremony""|""red""|""carpet""|""movies""|""actors""|""winners2018""|""2018""|""acceptance""|""speech""|""winner""|""90th""|""best""|""writing""|""original""|""screenplay""|""get""|""out""|""jordan""|""peele""|""Jordan Peele""|""Get Out""|""oscars 2018""|""acceptance speech""|""90th academy awards""|""best writing""|""original screenplay""|""jordan peele movie""|""get out""|""first oscar win""",13.0,332.0,2018,3,2018,3

Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150  Devel|""Sixteen""|""Devel Sixteen""|""Hypercar""|""Drag Racer""|""5000hp""|""Crazy""|""Fast""|""Ridiculous""|""Insane""|""Dubai""|""UAE""|""Motorshow""|""Launch""|""Premiere""|""Dubai Motorshow""|""DIMS""|""Exclusive""|""Introduction""|""Intro""|""V16""|""5000bhp""|""Fastest""|""Top Speed""|""Record""|""Shmee""|""Shmee150""",3.0,77.0,2017,11,2017,11

22,4117221,"""False""","""False""","Primitive Technology: Lime Primitive Technology At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty. Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a “lid” to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes “dead lime”, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It’s basically the ‘Glue’ that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.

The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  \n\nOl Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.  Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Phyllida Lloyd, Richard Curtis and Nicky Kentish Barnes also serve as executive producers.\n\nReprising their roles from Mamma Mia! The Movie are Academy Award® winner Meryl Streep as Donna, Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.\n\nAs the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends).

The John Campe Show John Campea On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Thursday, November 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nShahrukh Ali - My question is how can the studios release films that have seemingly incomplete or poor CGI ? Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it’s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point.

No single notes. \n\nA tritone is referring to a particular musical interval (how far away two notes are from each other) and is renowned for it's dissonance and harsh feeling of tension. A tritone name refers to the 3 whole tone distance between the two notes.\n\nIt's used to great effect in a lot of different genres, but straight up 2 note only tritone chords I most closely associate with Deathcore. And I can't think of anywhere else where it's used anywhere near as often. Particular the band Oceano came to mind while writing this.\n\nIt's rumored that the tritone was banned in medieval times, that you could be jailed for using it, that people believed it could summon the devil...  None of which are actually true, but make for a great story that really fits in well with this harsh musical interval.\n\nHere's me chatting about writing this after being thrust into the underworld: https://youtu.be/651DVX5w3Ow\n\nMixed by Ryan Fluff Bruce: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fluff191\nVideo edit by Jake Jarvi: https://www.youtube.com/pineappleboyfilms/\n\nThis video was made possible because of Patreon support from Tianyu Ge, Navin Antoine, Brad Tucker, Jaz Maglana, Blayd Malburne, Andrew Johnston, Cody Melcher, Caleb Chalfin, Otto Cate, Nicolette Kawata, Tyler Feinman, Haroon Rahman, Quintin Waldner, Hypergnome, Stefan Gunn, Andy AKA VaultsOfExtoth, Rob Harper, & many other awesome people on my Patreon page: http://www.patreon.com/RobScallon\nThank you so much!\n\nMusic videos go on the main.

Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.

Never cracked or dropped my phone in water since i owned a cell phone)\n-3 weeks later phone completely drains *slept with a few percent left in battery.\n-plugged charger to phone. \n-phone wont charge\n-called samsung , transferred to tech support, trouble shoot, then repair ticket started (3-4 week wait according to rep)\n-needing a phone was an issue so i called sprint to see if they could help me with my problem. Tech support, troubleshoot, cant help me because i didnt buy insurance, said i still would have to pay $75 for a replacement even with insurance(even if they sold me a lemon phone that was less than a month old) told me to go to a sprint store to see if they could help.\n-went to sprint store , waited 45 min , repair tech troubleshoot phone ,phone still not responding. \n-tech checks my account status to see what they could do, said i didnt have insurance so they couldnt do an exchange. Mentioned again i would have to pay $75 even if i had insurance and i still would have to wait for a replacement to come in which is most likely a refurbished device.\n- screw it so i sent it to samsung.\n- 3 weeks later got a refurbished phone with light scratches.\n-phone battery drains faster than usual,  apps freezing and crashing. \n-outcome of the situation... i paid full price for a used phone.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n@ 2:32 you can see the flash/line i was referring to.\n\n**UPDATE 12/24/2017\nI finally got the phone back. looks like I got back a refurbished phone. link below is to my other video / unboxing of the note 8.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6z0Nt0VyseM\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCompletely drained my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Battery.

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.

Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video near the town of Woolgoolga in NSW.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.  gnat swarm|""sand fly swarm""|""can insects hear""|""controlling fly swarm with voice""|""singing to insects""|""lord of the flies""|""gnat swarm reacting to singing""|""gnat swarm reacting to voice""|""gnat swams reacting to sound""|""acoustic response in insects""|""can flies hear""",3.0,83.0,2018,1,2018,1

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin.

People are also underestimating The Guardians of the Galaxy and the pop that will bring to IW since a lot of people didn’t know they are even apart of the avengers. Thoughts?\n\nRaymundo Lopez - Black Panther is now the MCU’s highest opening weekend for a stand alone movie. Do you think this gives confidence to Marvel that the MCU can survive and thrive once the original cast leaves? Do you also think this puts to rest the talks that the MCU needs to reboot after Thanos?\n\nJosh DeRose - After numerous false starts, it appears as though NBC might finally be moving forward with a companion series for The Office.

In the heart of Bearadise Ranch, Florida, Monica Welde and her son, Johnny IV, spend their days rolling around with bears that weigh up to 1,000lbs. The Welde family have looked after grizzly bears, black bears and polar bears for the last 91 years – using their license to provide for those in need of a home. But the family tradition came under threat last year when Monica’s husband, Johnny III, died of a heart attack just after he turned 60. But with the help of her son, a devastated Monica has put her loss to one side so she can concentrate on continuing the family legacy and caring for their beloved pet bears.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Rodrigo Gomez\nProducer: Danny Baggot, Ruby Coote  \nEditor: Sonia Estal \n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit ANIMALS.BARCROFT.TV: http://animals.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftAnimals on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftAnimals/\nFollow @BarcroftAnimals on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BarcroftAnimals\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/videos\n\nDownload the Barcroft TV iOS app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en  amazing news|""amazing stories""|""amazing story""|""amazing""|""barcroft animals""|""barcroft tv""|""film""|""video""|""documentary""|""Barcroftmediaanimalstag""|""Beast Buddies""|""bears""|""grizzly bears""|""Bearadise Ranch""|""Florida""|""black bears""|""polar bears""|""pets""|""unconventional""|""dangerous""|""pet bears""|""bear family""|""attack""|""Walt Disney""|""dangerous animals""|""wild animals""|""family legacy""|""tradition""|""bears living with humans""|""supersize pet""|""unusual""|""Barcroft Animals""|""236348""",5.0,143.0,2018,1,2018,1

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out! I didn't want to leave my flat for fear my existence would be snuffed out it felt so fragile.

Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of die-hard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.Sanju is a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “did this really happen?” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani.

24,2028672,"""False""","""False""","Netflix Acquires Seth Rogen Netflix World-renowned Canadian person, prolific marijuana-doer, and winner of the 2015 MTV Movie Award for “Best Kiss” Seth Q. Rogen has entered into a lifetime deal to transfer full ownership of his personal autonomy to Netflix, Inc. \n\n“I have known Seth for many years” said senior Netflix Development Executive Jareth Chumley. “After a wrap party in late 2017, Seth approached me and said something like ‘Jesus Fucking Christ Jarbear, I would sell my soul for a fuckin enchilada right now.’ And so basically that was how the idea was born. In the end we settled on a price a little higher than a standard Chili’s To-Go entree, but I’ll be damned, not by that much.”\n\n“As a general rule, I don’t really ‘read’ anything before I sign it,” replied Rogen when asked about the deal, spilling some beer on his own head as he does the finger-symbol equivalent of air quotes. “That’s what Danny is for, he handles that for me, mostly,” gesturing toward an elderly man in a poncho sleeping on the couch behind him. “Hey Danny!” he shouts, unable to wake his senior contract advisor. “I really hope he didn’t fuck this up. He’s the reason that Zach and Miri Make a Porno exists.”\n\nSeth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity is the first project where Netflix was able to successfully extract comedy directly from the actor’s mind. It will stream April 6. While the remaining projects Rogen will be participating in have not yet been finalized, Netflix is considering a live-action Shrek remake, starring Rogen as both the titular character, as well as that character’s love interest Fiona. There will also be other tasks considered, including some off-camera roles such as “executive foot massager” and “Quentin’s back waxer”. “The world really is our oyster here,” said Netflix Chief Operations Officer Karen Shartwell. “There really isn’t anything on earth that we can’t make him do.”\n\nWatch Hilarity For Charity on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80189646\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 117 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

But this house is so important to us, it's our freedom and future and we just couldn't be happier so thank you for always supporting us in whatever stupid stuff we decide to do and make.  It's been a long journey for me personally to get here, I know a lot of you have been here for years and I just want to say thank you.  I'm getting very emotional now so I'm just gonna stuff those feelings down and pretend they aren't happening lol.  I'm looking forward to ruining my future kitchen table with acrylic nail supplies etc. because the salon will live on know what I'm sayin.  Anyways though, we are incredibly happy, and the next time you see us we will be in our new home.

Lily has turned into a polished, upper-class teenager, with a fancy boarding school on her transcript and a coveted internship on her resume; Amanda has developed a sharp wit and her own particular attitude, but all in the process of becoming a social outcast. Though they initially seem completely at odds, the pair bond over Lily's contempt for her oppressive stepfather, Mark, and as their friendship grows, they begin to bring out one another's most destructive tendencies. Their ambitions lead them to hire a local hustler, Tim, and take matters into their own hands to set their lives straight.\n\nhttp://www.ThoroughbredsMovie.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ThoroughbredsMovie\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thoroughbreds/\nhttps://twitter.com/thoroughbreds  Focus Features|""Movies""|""Movie Trailers""|""Trailers""|""Independent Film""|""Cinema""|""Clips""|""Featurettes""|""thoroughbreds""|""thoroughbred""|""olivia cooke""|""anya taylor joy""|""anton yelchin""|""cory finley""|""fantastic fest""|""london film festival""|""sundance""|""heathers""|""american psycho""|""mean girls""|""horse""|""connecticut""|""rich""|""rich girls""|""betches""|""official trailer""|""teaser""|""new trailer""|""star trek""|""spring breakers""|""edge of seventeen""|""new mutant""|""disaster artist""|""itonya""|""horse movie""|""split""|""ready player one""|""xmen""",6.0,151.0,2017,11,2017,12

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‘return to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander’s household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids – where anyone could be a spy for Gilead – all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her.  hulu",8.0,198.0,2018,3,2018,4

Watch the OFFICIAL TRAILER for Trust, FX’s new series from Academy Award winners Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson. Premieres March 25th.\n\nSubscribe now for more Trust clips: http://bit.ly/SubscribeFX \n\nTrust delves into the trials and triumphs of one of America’s wealthiest and unhappiest families, the Gettys. Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and an examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.  \n\nTold over multiple seasons and spanning the twentieth century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson), an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldn’t pay for the return of a loved one? \nPaul’s grandfather, J. Paul Getty (Donald Sutherland), an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. He’s busy. Paul’s father, J. Paul Getty Jr. (Michael Esper), is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paul’s mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, she’s broke. Trust charts the teenage grandson’s nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.\n\nThe cast also includes Brendan Fraser, Anna Chancellor, Norbert Leo Butz, Charlotte Riley and Luca Marinelli.\n\nTrust is created by Simon Beaufoy. Danny Boyle has directed the first three episodes. Executive Producers are Christian Colson, Beaufoy and Boyle.

Set during the final week of Jesus' life, the story is told from the perspective of infamous betrayer Judas Iscariot. As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle, an all-star cast of beloved recording artists and a fresh soundtrack featuring such hits as Heaven on Their Minds, I Don't Know How to Love Him and Superstar.\n\nSuperstar: Brandon Victor Dixon - Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\nhttps://youtu.be/yleuZbY8rKk\n\nNBC on YouTube\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbc  jesus christ superstar|""broadway cast""|""john legend""|""sara bareilles""|""alice cooper""|""king herod""|""brandon victor dixon""|""norm lewis""|""jason tam""|""jin ha""|""ben daniels""|""easter sunday""|""jesus christ concert""|""andrew lloyd webber""|""tim rice""|""rock opera""|""superstar""|""NBC""|""NBC network""|""tv""|""tv shows""|""2018""|""entertainment""|""episode""|""full episode""|""trailer""|""golden globes""|""red nose day""|""comedy""|""free tv""|""watch tv""|""watch episodes""|""Easter""",0.0,20.0,2018,4,2018,4

Sleep deprivation can contribute to obesity, diabetes, inflammation, heart disease, and more. The minimum recommended amount for adults is 7 hours (this too can vary from person to person). But, a third of Americans are sleep deprived — and on average, Black Americans are clocking in the least amount of z’s. \n\nBlack Americans already face steep disparities in health, and not getting enough good sleep can compound on those issues. By examining the sleep gap, and addressing the root causes, we may be able to tackle other inequalities in the US too.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Push notifications buzz in your pocket, red bubbles demand attention, and endless distractions sit at your fingertips. It can feel impossible to pull away from. But that’s kind of the point. When people talk about the “attention economy,” they’re referring to the fact that your time and attention are the currency on which today’s applications make money. Because apps profit off of the total time you spend on their platform, there’s a strong incentive to use psychological tricks  to keep you endlessly hooked. But it doesn’t have to be this way.

Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years.

Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there’s a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it’s great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. \n\nBut this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from — some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon.

Pictures http://readyplayeronemovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://twitter.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://instagram.com/readyplayerone\n\n-- \n\nFrom filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.  \n\nThe film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”\n\nSlated for release on March 29, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. \n\nDirected by J.A.

Being in zero gravity for extended periods of time does some wacky things to the human body. Unless aliens show up and teach us how to deal with these unique challenges, it’s up to scientists to discover ways for the human body to cope.\nSubscribe for more! ► http://bit.ly/BeAmazedSubscribe ◄\nStay updated ► http://bit.ly/BeAmazedFacebook https://twitter.com/BeAmazedVideos https://instagram.com/BeAmazedVideos ◄ \nFor copyright queries or general inquiries please get in touch: beamazedvideos@gmail.com\nCredit: https://pastebin.com/zqUjCLhq\n\nBe Amazed at these Top 10 Things That Happen To Your Body In Space! Muscle Atrophy - Gravity, of course, is what allows you to walk around on the earth with your feet on the ground. In space, your main mode of transportation is floating instead.  Space Eurphoria - The mind is the most important part of the body, so how is it affected by living up in space? Many astronauts have reported that their time in space was a seriously enlightening and perspective changing time of their life. Space Radiation - Luckily for us down here on earth, our atmosphere protects us from cosmic radiation. However, Astronauts outside this atmosphere - out in space - do not have this luxurious blanket, and so they're exposed to ten times more radiation than they would be if they were on earth. Vision problems - If you spend too much time in space, the backs of your eyeballs will flatten just a tiny little bit. This is as bad as it sounds, and it causes your vision to blur. \n\nA Strange Smell - One question that isn’t really explored in many science fiction books or films is what exactly does space smell like? Wouldn’t it just smell like whatever earth smells like? Space Adaption Syndrome - If you go too long without earths’ gravity holding down your body, you could end up with “space sickness”, formally known as space adaption syndrome. Confinement Craziness - If you have a family, a roommate, or have even simply interacted with another human being, you should know that if you put a bunch of people in a confined area for an extended period of time, problems are bound to arise. Your immune system gets worse - Space also takes a toll on your immune system, which you need to protect your body against diseases more than ever in space. You’ll lose bone mass - Here on earth, you maintain your bones thanks to the natural power of gravity and mechanical loading. Osteoblasts, which are cells that regulate the bone matrix, and osteoclasts, which absorb one matrix, continually remodel your bone mass. Your heart weakens - The heart, perhaps the most important muscle you have, is also affected by a lack of gravity. The very size and shape of the human heart is changed by a trip to space.  beamazed|""be amazed""|""top 10""|""science""|""space""|""facts""|""NASA""|""earth""|""astronaut""|""space travel""|""top10""|""outer space""|""black hole""|""Spacesuit""|""what happens""|""vacuum""|""planet""|""Cosmonaut""|""gravity""|""Humans""|""International Space Station""|""space myths""|""Tech""|""universe""|""10s""|""lack of oxygen""",3.0,76.0,2017,12,2017,12

Lily has turned into a polished, upper-class teenager, with a fancy boarding school on her transcript and a coveted internship on her resume; Amanda has developed a sharp wit and her own particular attitude, but all in the process of becoming a social outcast. Though they initially seem completely at odds, the pair bond over Lily's contempt for her oppressive stepfather, Mark, and as their friendship grows, they begin to bring out one another's most destructive tendencies. Their ambitions lead them to hire a local hustler, Tim, and take matters into their own hands to set their lives straight.\n\nhttp://www.ThoroughbredsMovie.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ThoroughbredsMovie\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thoroughbreds/\nhttps://twitter.com/thoroughbreds  Focus Features|""Movies""|""Movie Trailers""|""Trailers""|""Independent Film""|""Cinema""|""Clips""|""Featurettes""|""thoroughbreds""|""thoroughbred""|""olivia cooke""|""anya taylor joy""|""anton yelchin""|""cory finley""|""fantastic fest""|""london film festival""|""sundance""|""heathers""|""american psycho""|""mean girls""|""horse""|""connecticut""|""rich""|""rich girls""|""betches""|""official trailer""|""teaser""|""new trailer""|""star trek""|""spring breakers""|""edge of seventeen""|""new mutant""|""disaster artist""|""itonya""|""horse movie""|""split""|""ready player one""|""xmen""",3.0,79.0,2017,11,2017,12

Learn more at http://omele.to/2n1IT2q.\n\nGeorge attends the competitive private school Auburn Academy, where he struggles to keep up with the other students.\n\nAuburn is a harsh, even cruel, place, full of overachievers who are often mean to the boy -- if they aren't completely ignoring him. It doesn't help that his dad is the school's janitor, either, who picks up his son in a rickety old car everyday.\n\nBut George's dad decides to stand up for his kid, showing just how far a parent will go to love and support their child -- even if it means possible further humiliation.\n\nDirector Andrew Mudge has crafted a sweet, delightful dramedy full of genuine heart and compassion. Its charming quirks -- minimal dialogue for the main characters, soaring score and meticulous and witty production design -- never overwhelm the film.\n\nThe Perfect Gooseys wears its sincerity and emotion proudly, earning every second of its touching finale -- and reminding us what really matters when it comes to what teach our families.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nConnect with Omeleto!\n\nFacebook ► http://facebook.com/omeletocom/\nTwitter ► http://twitter.com/omeletocom\nInstagram ► http://instagram.com/omeletocom/\nSnapchat ► http://snapchat.com/add/omeletocom\nNewsletter ► http://omeleto.com/join/\n\n🎬 Got a film?

I don’t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention.

Only at T-Mobile.http://bit.ly/2iZDff8\nMore Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nThe show that’s had us all obsessed for over a year and a half now has a possibly concerning new update. In an interview with Variety at the Dubai International Film Festival, David Harbour – aka Chief Jim Hopper – revealed that the third season of the hit sci-fi series probably won’t hit Netflix until 2019! It’s not even 2018 now. That means we might have to wait more than a year to get the goods of season 3.\n\nAs soon as those words came out of his mouth the internet went into a frenzy, with fans around the globe tweeting angry gifs with the text “When you realize you have to wait until 2013 for season 3 of stranger things.” Now, the good news is that while we impatiently wait, the Duffer brothers responsible for those amazing scripts are working hard to create an unforgettable third season. \n\nChief Hopper even revealed that the writers basically just sit in their apartments day in and day out for like 12-14 hours a day and just WRITE. And we thank you for your service. On another note, the weekend that Stranger Things was released gave Netflix its biggest streaming day in the UK in all of 2017. By Sunday, October 29th, many fans had literally binged the entire second season in under 24 hours. \n\nLet’s learn our lesson and take our time in season 3. But I want to hear from you: how you feeling that we might have to wait like a thousand years for the next season. Between the wait time for Game of Thrones and now Stranger Things, I might just give up on TV altogether. It’s becoming so cruel! Anyway, share your thoughts below on what your predictions for season 3 are and your favorite show you’re currently waiting on.

22,3927954,"""False""","""False""","Primitive Technology: A-frame hut Primitive Technology I built an A frame hut as a large work space for projects. First I made a celt hatchet to cut timber for the hut. The axe head was made of amphibolite and the handle was made of a species of wattle. For the hut the floor plan was 4 X 4m. The height of the ridgeline was 2 m above the ground. +A post was planted in the ground to support the ridge pole at the back of the structure and an A frame was put in the front to support the ridgeline. The rafters of the hut were then attached to the ridgepole. Palm fronds were then collected, split and lashed to this frame. The dome hut was disassembled and its thatch was added to the structure. Approximately 1200 fronds were used in total. For the ridgeline, thatch was lifted in place and rested on without lashing it down. Instead, pairs of sticks lashed together were lifted in place sitting over thatch preventing it from blowing away. These are known as “jockeys” as they resemble a rider sitting on a horse.\nA wall of wattle and daub was built at the back of the structure. Wooden poles were planted into the ground and lawyer cane was woven between them. Soil was dug from around the hut forming drainage trenches while also supplying the mud used to daub the wall. No fibre was added to the daub, just straight mud. Pegs were stuck into the wall to form a convenient rack to hold the stone axe off the ground when not in use. Later, pegs were added to support the fire sticks too. A bed was made by hammering in wooden stakes and lashing timber to the frame. This was covered with palm fibre to act as bedding. Atherton oak nuts were then collected and eaten/stored in a pot. Latter, heavy rain fell testing the huts ability to shed rain. The hut stayed dry while the water flowed off the thatch and into the drainage trenches left over from digging the mud for the wall.\nThe A frame hut is a simple shelter that can be built quickly and simply. It’s basically a large roof built directly on the ground. The shape is strong and should resist strong winds. This hut is the biggest one I’ve built on this channel and could fit both the tiled roof hut and wattle and daub hut inside it with room left over along the sides. It requires no scaffolding or ladders to build. A person can walk right down the centre without ducking while the sides that are too low to stand in are used for storing firewood, tools and other things. A fire lit in the entrance will greatly reduce the number of mosquitoes in the hut though it will get smokey occasionally. To reduce smoke, a small stove could be built to burn the wood more efficiently. A chimney and fireplace could be built also, but would take more time.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.

With a fresh sound that mixes old-school soul vocals and R&B beats, the Colombian singer caught the attention of hip-hop artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tyler, The Creator. Uchis has since built a resume of additional collaborations with Tyler, Miguel, and Latin music superstar Juanes. She also grabbed her first Grammy nomination this year for Best R&B Performance, as a feature on Daniel Caesar’s track “Get You.”\n\nUchis' latest hit is the retro-sounding and smooth single “After The Storm,” featuring Tyler and funk legend Bootsy Collins. Racking in over 6 million streams on YouTube, the song tackles themes of survival and inner conflict. Uchis also references her own personal difficulties of living U.S., far away from her Colombian family members.\n\nRead more on Genius: https://genius.com/a/kali-uchis-breaks-down-official-lyrics-for-after-the-storm-on-genius-video-series-verified\n\nRead all the lyrics to After The Storm on Genius: https://genius.com/Kali-uchis-after-the-storm-lyrics\n\nSubscribe to Genius: http://bit.ly/2cNV6nz\nGenius on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Genius\nGenius on Instagram: http://instagram.com/genius\nGenius on Facebook: https://facebook.com/Geniusdotcom\nhttp://genius.com  genius|""rap genius""|""verified""|""official lyrics""|""lyrics""|""lyric video""|""Lyric videos""|""pop music""|""hip hop""|""rap""|""new pop music""|""nadia lee cohen""|""badbadnotgood""|""hero""|""tyrant""|""nuestro""|""planeta""|""kaliuchis""|""jorja smith""|""bootsy collins""|""tyler""|""the creator""|""kelela""|""khelani""|""after the storm""|""NewSingle""",4.0,101.0,2018,2,2018,2

We went for a full on Mexican street food tour in Puebla, Mexico, and discovered the most incredible FAST cutting sandwich lady, with the fastest knife cutting skills, kind of like the Super Human Sandwich Fruit Ninja of Mexico, along with amazing tacos with spicy salsa and delicious mole poblano! ALL of the Best Mexican Street Food!\n\nIn this street food tour vlog, we venture outside of Mexico city to Puebla, to eat the best street food in Mexico and taste the world famous Mole sauce over top of juicy chicken. It was spicy, full of chili, and so delicious. \n\nThe Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious\n\nWe started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dHnqNOvDi44\nhttps://youtu.be/W0Anp0wmXek\n\nAfter this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. \n\nAfter those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more and found delicious salads and pickled chilies that blew my mouth off, they were so hot and spicy!\n\nAfter this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!\n\nAfter exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. \n\nAfter eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.\n\nHere are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:\n\n1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square\n2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market\n3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market\n4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros\n5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER \n\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious street food as I can .

Because it attaches to you with a mouth covered in hooks, while it fattens up on your blood. For days. But don't worry – there *is* a way to pull it out.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world.  Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\nSpring is here. Unfortunately for hikers and picnickers out enjoying the warmer weather, the new season is prime time for ticks, which can transmit bacteria that cause Lyme disease. \n\nHow they latch on – and stay on – is a feat of engineering that scientists have been piecing together. Once you know how a tick’s mouth works, you understand why it’s impossible to simply flick a tick. \n\nThe key to their success is a menacing mouth covered in hooks that they use to get under the surface of our skin and attach themselves for several days while they fatten up on our blood.\n\n“Ticks have a lovely, evolved mouth part for doing exactly what they need to do, which is extended feeding,” said Kerry Padgett, supervising public health biologist at the California Department of Public Health in Richmond. “They're not like a mosquito that can just put their mouth parts in and out nicely, like a hypodermic needle.”\n\nInstead, a tick digs in using two sets of hooks. Each set looks like a hand with three hooked fingers. The hooks dig in and wriggle into the skin. Then these “hands” bend in unison to perform approximately half-a-dozen breaststrokes that pull skin out of the way so the tick can push in a long stubby part called the hypostome.\n\n“It’s almost like swimming into the skin,” said Dania Richter, a biologist at the Technische Universität in Braunschweig, Germany, who has studied the mechanism closely. “By bending the hooks it’s engaging the skin. It’s pulling the skin when it retracts.”\n\nThe bottom of their long hypostome is also covered in rows of hooks that give it the look of a chainsaw. Those hooks act like mini-harpoons, anchoring the tick to us for the long haul.\n\n“They’re teeth that are backwards facing, similar to one of those gates you would drive over but you're not allowed to back up or else you'd puncture your tires,” said Padgett.\n\n--- How to remove a tick.\nKerry Padgett, at the California Department of Public Health, recommends grabbing the tick close to the skin using a pair of fine tweezers and simply pulling straight up.\n\n“No twisting or jerking,” she said. “Use a smooth motion pulling up.”\n\nPadgett warned against using other strategies.    \n\n“Don't use Vaseline or try to burn the tick or use a cotton swab soaked in soft soap or any of these other techniques that might take a little longer or might not work at all,” she said. “You really want to remove the tick as soon as possible.”\n\n---  What happens if the mouth of a tick breaks off in your skin?\nDon’t worry if the tick’s mouth parts stay behind when you pull. \n\n“The mouth parts are not going to transmit disease to people,” said Padgett. \n\nIf the mouth stayed behind in your skin, it will eventually work its way out, sort of like a splinter does, she said. Clean the bite area with soap and water and apply antibiotic ointment.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1920972/how-ticks-dig-in-with-a-mouth-full-of-hooks\n\n---+ For more information: \nCenters for Disease Control information on Lyme disease:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/lyme/\n\nMosquito & Vector Control District for San Mateo County, California:\nhttps://www.smcmvcd.org/ticks\n\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes: \n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU\n\nSo … Sometimes Fireflies Eat Other Fireflies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWdCMFvgFbo\n\nMeet the Dust Mites, Tiny Roommates That Feast On Your Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACrLMtPyRM0\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios! \n\nAbove the Noise: Are Energy Drinks Really that Bad?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l0cjsZS-eM\n\nIt’s Okay To Be Smart: Inside an ICE CAVE! - Nature's Most Beautiful Blue\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LKm9jtm8I\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science: \nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science \nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED \nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

25,743419,"""False""","""False""","Why the Oscars love method actors Vox Almost half of all Best Actor and Actress awards have been won by method actors since 1951.\n\nGetting excited about the Oscars? Check out our expert analysis at Vox: http://bit.ly/2F7xfyW\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nMethod acting's foundational theory originated in the Soviet Union during the early 20th century. It was created by Konstantin Stanislavski and his peers at the Moscow Art Theater as a framework for systematically training young actors. Method acting became influential in the US in the ’30s and ’40s, pioneered by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, and Sanford Meisner, each of whom transformed and built on Stanislavski’s system.\n\nToday, training in method acting is ubiquitous for aspiring actors. But at the same time, the stakes of method acting continue to rise. First popularized in the US during the 1950s by Marlon Brando's generation of Hollywood stars, method acting continues to be a consistent way for actors to push themselves in new roles. But while method acting won Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, it's undeniable that the way method acting is promoted is conspicuously marketable. Still, it has undoubtedly led to some of the greatest performances of all time.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

I dove into the comments section to see what medical tv drama you wanted me to review next and it seemed like the good doctor was the obvious choice. Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =] \n\nFull disclosure, I have never watched an episode of the good doctor on ABC so I decided to go ahead and start my tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( good doctor 1x01 ) of the series. I was really curious myself to see if the good doctor is a medically accurate show.\n\nI really did enjoy this medical tv show because I think it did a lot of things well. It gave an interesting look into what life is like a for a surgeon and a resident. Being a surgical resident is not an easy job and to make the situation even more complex Dr. Sean Murphy has autism so they did a great job of breaking down these circumstances.\n\nI hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor / Real Doctor Reacts to the Good Doctor.

This is the second oldest thing I've ever eaten (Oldest was that Hardtack) and much unexpected considering this MRE's condition. It was pretty rough - and the smell when cooking the dried beef (Pretty much a pemmican) is nearly indescribable. It was quite the experience. And for old rations up next we will see the next generation in Emergency Rations - (1918). This is pioneering in food technology - the beef was still edible. It was a pulverized, slow cooked, dried, and compressed meat by-product bar. Way ahead of it's time - this was food tech that was adopted by the U.S. Quartermaster Corps of Sustenance and Natick Food Labs decades later.\n\nFor correspondence, or to send a Military Ration for review, my mailing information is: \nSteve1989\n3616 Harden Blvd\n#360\nLakeland, FL 33803 \n\nhttp://www.mremarketplace.com/\n\nhttp://www.mreinfo.com/\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/user?u=2821334&ty=h\n\nAnd thank you everyone for watching & subscribing - hope \nyou enjoyed this one, as I certainly did making it!\n-Steve\n** All Music By:  Steve1989 MREinfo **\n\n\nCheck out the other awesome YT reviewers:\n\n\nOldsmokey:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL1wSC0Ntw8KWgTM-TRHFOQ\n\nRC Gusto:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBEYgWflPKsDI_i6AmD5sA\n\ngschultz9:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gschultz9\n\nstickyfingaz745:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEqR37txqYozXbbitVDd7A\n\n\ngundog4314:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7dAKknI_zWUNcz36T0Lp6w\n\nemmymadeinjapan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzqbfYjQmf9nLQPMxVgPhiA\n\nKiwi Dude:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIUTBxBxmMMY2bUJqYITJxw\n\n\nPaul Buikema:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ51mn3lFHIyMYxX74ViCPg\n\nElandil:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspVo4xdz9JPpPV6d6jp9wQ\n\nMrBrowningm1911\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVoA8_rDsAcMF2UkfCO4n4A\n\ndingo7055:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8dvHS5J4Kqn79p6ScmWqw\n\nSparrowMedicine:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8TnFxqRz-PTS-yowf6S5kw  mre|""ration""|""army""|""food""|""military""|""meal""|""ready""|""to""|""eat""|""pack""|""survival""|""camping""|""emergency""|""ASMR""|""steve1989""|""mreinfo""|""steve""|""mci""|""ww2""|""korea""|""vietnam""|""gulf""|""war""|""modern""|""civilian""|""packaged""|""packet""|""oldest""|""cigarette""|""smoked""|""eaten""|""tasting""|""crazy""|""rarest""|""amazing""|""SHTF""|""review""|""MRE""|""Steve""|""Taste""|""Test""|""Oldest Meat Ever Eaten""|""Oldest MRE Eaten""|""Oldest Beef""|""Steve1989MREinfo""|""Boer War Ration""|""Emergency Ration (Field Service)""|""MRE Guy""|""MRE Review""",12.0,311.0,2018,4,2018,4

Willink, former Navy SEAL and author of Way of the Warrior Kid explains the one habit from service that he can't shake.For the full interview, search for Success! How I Did It on Apple Podcasts or your favorite app. https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/success-how-i-did-it/id1205997729?mt=2 Business Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, science, retail, and more.Subscribe to our channel and visit us at: http://www.businessinsider.com/BI on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider/BI on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/businessinsider/BI on Twitter: https://twitter.com/businessinsider--------------------------------------------------Following is a transcript of the video:Richard Feloni: Are there some things from your service that you can't shake? So for example, you still wake up at 4:30 in the morning, to go workout, what was it about your time in the Seals, that you wanted to keep these habits up?Jocko Willink: They're good habits, why would you not wake up at 4:30?Richard Feloni: Well what does this bring to you?Jocko Willink: Waking up early? You just get a jump on the day. The reason I wake up at 4:30 in the morning is because no one else is awake yet, so that gives me the opportunity to do things that I need to get done, kinda selfishly for myself, and the big one in that category is working out. And it doesn't feel good at 4:30 when you get up, but by the time 7 o'clock rolls around, and you've already worked out, and you've already got some work done, and you've got some time to say goodbye to your kids before they go to school? It's infinitely better than sleeping in until 6:45, and you get out of bed, and now you've missed your kids going to school, or whatever. You're not prepared for the day, it's awful.Feloni: So if someone, maybe they don't have time to work out or they just need something that could be like a quick fix, is there something that you recommend?Willink: Oh yeah, workouts don't have to take a long time. Workouts can be very quick. Matter of fact, go do two minutes of burpees, as many burpees as you can, in two minutes, or four minutes, or six minutes, go and sprint, go and do anything very intensely, for a short period of time and you'll get great benefit out of it.Feloni: Something I'm sure you hear a lot is 4:30, like this either just can't fit into my schedule, or if I'm gonna be realistic, I'm probably not gonna wake up at 4:30, what do you tell people who say that?Willink: Yeah, and there's people that work night shifts, and there's people that it's unhealthy for them, they can't fall as-- it's like no, be healthy, get enough sleep, but, first of all, wake up at the same time every day and, if you pick that time and you start waking up at the same time every day, that's very good for you. It doesn't have to be 4:30, it could be 6:30, it could be 7, I don't know what your personal schedule is, but find out a time, pick it, set it, stick to it, and maintain that schedule, and that's gonna end up better for you.I recommend it's earlier. I recommend that you go to bed earlier, 'cause what are you doing at night, most of the time? Most of the time at night, you're not working on anything super productive, you're just winding down and watching stupid YouTube videos, or surfing the internet, reading clickbait stories, right? Don't do that, instead, go to sleep, and then wake up early.Feloni: Could you explain that notion of discipline equals freedom?Willink: If you want more freedom in your life, you have to have more discipline. If you don't have any discipline, you'll end up with absolutely no freedom, you'll end up being a slave to other people that boss you around. There's all kind of problems that can occur, if you don't have discipline in your life. And the more discipline you have, the more freedom you're gonna have.Feloni: So just the discipline of the Seals, will never-- it's impossible to leave?Willink: No, it's possible to leave, there's retired seals all over the place that are undisciplined. They've moved on, and they don't care about that anymore. It's fine, I don't judge other people on what they're doin', like they're probably stoked to sleep in and hang out with their kids, and eat breakfast in bed, that's fine. I don't have anything against that. But for me? I wanna get up and go.

In the in depth interview, Coogler touched on how personal the movie Creed was, and how it truly was a story about his own father, before explaining: “There’s timing, and that film for whatever reason it had to go when it’s going.”\n\nZac Efron took to his Instagram to share some of the first looks of him and the cast of the Ted Bundy biopic entitled Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile. The images show Efron in a number of behind the scenes looks, as well as working alongside The Big Bang Theory star Jim Parson.\n\nIn a recent Reddit AMA with director Alex Garland and his latest, Annihilation, Garland revealed that another adaptation of his novel The Beach was in the works with “someone very talented.”\n\nStudio Canal UK released the first trailer for Sundance thriller Yardie, marking the feature directorial debut of Idris Elba.

Pictures From Clint Eastwood comes The 15:17 to Paris - in theaters February 9.\n\nhttp://www.1517toparis.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1517toparis\nhttps://twitter.com/1517toParis\nhttps://www.instagram.com/1517toparis\n\n--\n\nFrom Clint Eastwood comes “The 15:17 to Paris,” which tells the real-life story of three men whose brave act turned them into heroes during a highspeed railway ride.\n\nIn the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris—an attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.  The film follows the course of the friends’ lives, from the struggles of childhood through finding their footing in life, to the series of unlikely events leading up to the attack.  Throughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.\n\nThe heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.  Starring alongside them are Jenna Fischer (“Hall Pass,” TV’s “The Office”); Judy Greer (“War for the Planet of the Apes”); Ray Corasani (TV’s upcoming “The Long Road Home”); PJ Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”); Tony Hale (TV’s “Veep”); and Thomas Lennon (“Transformers: Age of Extinction”).  Paul-Mikél Williams plays the younger Anthony, Bryce Gheisar plays the younger Alek, and William Jennings plays the younger Spencer.\n\nEastwood (“Sully,” “American Sniper”) directs from a screenplay by Dorothy Blyskal, based on the book by Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, Spencer Stone and Jeffrey E. Stern.  Eastwood also produces the film, along with Tim Moore, Kristina Rivera and Jessica Meier.  The film’s executive producer is Bruce Berman.\n\nBehind the scenes, the creative team includes frequent collaborators Tom Stern, who served as cinematographer on 13 of Eastwood’s previous films, and Deborah Hopper, who has served as Eastwood’s costume designer on 17 prior films; editor Blu Murray, who most recently cut “Sully,” and that film’s composer, Christian Jacob.  Veteran art director Kevin Ishioka, whose work can be seen in “Sully” and in “Dunkirk,” serves as production designer.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, a Malpaso production, “The 15:17 to Paris.”  The film will be released in theaters on February 9, 2018.  It will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company, and in select territories by Village Roadshow Pictures.  the 15:17 to paris|""the 15:17 to paris movie""|""clint eastwood""|""anthony sadler""|""alek skarlatos""|""spencer stone""|""jenna fischer""|""judy greer""|""ray corasani""|""pj byrne""|""tony hale""|""thomas lennon""|""wb pictures""|""wb pics""|""trailers""|""wb trailers""|""15:17 to paris""|""the 15:17 to paris trailer""|""15:17 to paris trailer""|""15:17 paris movie""",4.0,105.0,2017,12,2017,12

It’s a must visit, to see the energy and life at the market.The Accra Arts Center - Finally, we stopped off at the Accra Arts Center to buy a few things before leaving in at night.Accra to Nairobi - We had a late night flight, and we landed early at sunrise to cool Nairobi!After checking into a hotel just for 1 night, we took a quick hour nap, and then jumped into a taxi to go meet my Dad who was staying at a guesthouse.It was great to see my Dad and at the guesthouse we compared our ancestry and our taste preference.

Other than that brief period on Game of Thrones when she dyed her hair black, the lady of Winterfell never strays from her signature red color. But the actress that plays her, Sophie Turner, is far more experimental. She's dyed her hair from blonde to red and back again more times than she'd like to recall. Turner's also been the face of haircare brand Wella Professionals since June 2017, so it's safe to say she knows a thing or two about good hair.\nOf all the hairstyles on Game of Thrones, braids reign supreme. To test her knowledge, we asked Turner to look at a series of hairstyles and guess whether they were from Westeros or the runway. \n\nSubscribe to Harper's Bazaar: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoBAZAAR\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar\nhttps://twitter.com/harpersbazaarus\nhttps://www.instagram.com/harpersbazaarus/\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/harpersbazaar/?auto_follow=1  bazaar|""harper's bazaar""|""harpers bazaar""|""harpers bazaar magazine""|""fashion""|""fashion trends""|""style""|""clothing""|""fashion design""|""women""|""runway""|""women's lifestyle""|""luxury""|""chic""|""luxury items""|""Joe Jonas""|""Sansa Stark""|""Sophie Turner""|""Game of Thrones""|""Game of Thrones Hairstyles""|""Wella Professionals""|""Sophie Turner Engagement Ring""|""Winterfell""|""House Stark""|""Runway""|""Models""",13.0,317.0,2018,3,2018,3

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA.

Get my Quidd stickers here: http://bit.ly/2BnSxF8 , my username is safiyany!\n\nSo I have done a few bad makeup science experiments before with my own nude lipsticks, foundations, eyeshadows, liquid lipsticks, and highlighters, but I wanted to think bigger this time, and go outside of my own makeup box to see what insights on Sephora I could get by melting one of every lipstick they carry in their store. So we melted 603 lipsticks from 20 different brands, and made 500 to send to you all!\n\nDisclaimers:\n1) We washed our hands every time we handled the lipsticks and essentially boiled the lipsticks on the stove as well. \n2) We wore latex gloves and used almond oil when removing the lipsticks from their molds.\n3) Please leave your twitter or insta handle in your comment, so we can contact you!\n4) We can only ship to North American subscribers this time around (since we have so many to ship).\n\nDon’t forget to click the bell to turn on post notifications!\n\nSafiya's Nextbeat: https://nextbeat.co/u/safiya\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajn\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/\n\nAssistant Editor: Emily Linden\n\nMusic\nMind The Gap\nTop Banana\nPeanut Man\nMojo Nation\nWhiskey Attitude\nFunk Diving\nFiesta Brava\nGypsy Sailor\nSharp Dresser\nMesmers Fantasy\nHot Sole\nSpy\nvia Audio Network\n\nSFX\nVia Audioblocks  melting every lipstick from sephora together|""melting lipsticks""|""frankenlipstick""|""lipstick""|""melting""|""mixing""|""mixing makeup""|""melting makeup""|""makeup""|""sephora""|""safiya lipstick""|""safiya makeup""|""safiya""|""safiya nygaard""|""bad makeup science""|""dior""|""kat von d""|""anastasia beverly hills""|""too faced""|""urban decay""|""safia""",4.0,100.0,2018,4,2018,4

Thank you!Every once in a while, all the oaks or spruces or other plants in a region suddenly produce a tremendous bounty of seeds – up to 100 times more than usual.
