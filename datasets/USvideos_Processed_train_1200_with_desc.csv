Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends.

22,4209089,"""False""","""False""","Primitive Technology: A-frame hut Primitive Technology I built an A frame hut as a large work space for projects. First I made a celt hatchet to cut timber for the hut. The axe head was made of amphibolite and the handle was made of a species of wattle. For the hut the floor plan was 4 X 4m. The height of the ridgeline was 2 m above the ground. +A post was planted in the ground to support the ridge pole at the back of the structure and an A frame was put in the front to support the ridgeline. The rafters of the hut were then attached to the ridgepole. Palm fronds were then collected, split and lashed to this frame. The dome hut was disassembled and its thatch was added to the structure. Approximately 1200 fronds were used in total. For the ridgeline, thatch was lifted in place and rested on without lashing it down. Instead, pairs of sticks lashed together were lifted in place sitting over thatch preventing it from blowing away. These are known as “jockeys” as they resemble a rider sitting on a horse.\nA wall of wattle and daub was built at the back of the structure. Wooden poles were planted into the ground and lawyer cane was woven between them. Soil was dug from around the hut forming drainage trenches while also supplying the mud used to daub the wall. No fibre was added to the daub, just straight mud. Pegs were stuck into the wall to form a convenient rack to hold the stone axe off the ground when not in use. Later, pegs were added to support the fire sticks too. A bed was made by hammering in wooden stakes and lashing timber to the frame. This was covered with palm fibre to act as bedding. Atherton oak nuts were then collected and eaten/stored in a pot. Latter, heavy rain fell testing the huts ability to shed rain. The hut stayed dry while the water flowed off the thatch and into the drainage trenches left over from digging the mud for the wall.\nThe A frame hut is a simple shelter that can be built quickly and simply. It’s basically a large roof built directly on the ground. The shape is strong and should resist strong winds. This hut is the biggest one I’ve built on this channel and could fit both the tiled roof hut and wattle and daub hut inside it with room left over along the sides. It requires no scaffolding or ladders to build. A person can walk right down the centre without ducking while the sides that are too low to stand in are used for storing firewood, tools and other things. A fire lit in the entrance will greatly reduce the number of mosquitoes in the hut though it will get smokey occasionally. To reduce smoke, a small stove could be built to burn the wood more efficiently. A chimney and fireplace could be built also, but would take more time.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.

In the modern world, the idea of trying to be good or kind conjures up all sorts of negative associations: of piety, solemnity, bloodlessness and sexual renunciation. It’s telling that ‘wicked’ has even become a term of praise.\nAnd yet the project of being good is as vital, or even more important, for the individual and society as is the project of being healthy. Yet while we have no problem with going to the gym to get fitter, it sounds deeply weird, even creepy, to suggest that one might ‘work’ at being better or nicer…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/17DqjX\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nOur website has classes, articles and products to help you think and grow: https://goo.gl/b461ah\n\nWatch more films on RELATIONSHIPS in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLrelationships\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/7m4wde\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n \nKhyan Mansley\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Khyan1\nhttps://twitter.com/khyan?lang=en  the school of life|""relationships""|""alain de botton""|""sermon""|""philosophy""|""London""|""talk""|""self""|""improvement""|""curriculum""|""big questions""|""love""|""wellness""|""mindfullness""|""psychology""|""hack""|""new year""|""resolutions""|""how to be better""|""2018""|""how to be a better person""|""PL-RELATIONSHIPS""|""better""|""new years resolution""|""2018 resolution""|""motivation for 2018""|""motivation""|""2017""|""tony robbins""|""school of life""|""how to slay 2018""|""inspiration""|""morning motivation""",6,154,2017,12,2018,1

Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of diehard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.\n\nSanju is in turns a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “did this really happen?” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.\n\nStarring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani. \n \nDirected by: Rajkumar Hirani. \n \nProduced by: Vinod Chopra Films and Rajkumar Hirani Films in association with Fox Star Studios.\n\nAlso Subscribe To \nFoxStarIndia: http://goo.gl/Y8HGhY\nFoxStarSouth : http://goo.gl/AO8IsZ\n\nSocial Media Links\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/foxstarhindi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/foxstarhindi\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/foxstarhindi\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/foxstarhindi/\n\nDailymotion:\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/FoxStarHindi  Sanju Teaser|""Official Teaser""|""Sanju Official Teaser""|""sanjay dutt biopic""|""sanjay dutt biopic teaser""|""sanjay dutt biopic film""|""sanjay dutt new movie""|""rajkumar hirani movies""|""Ranbir Kapoor""|""Paresh Rawal""|""Manisha Koirala""|""Anushka Sharma""|""Sonam Kapoor""|""Dia Mirza""|""Vicky Kaushal""|""Jim Sarbh""|""Boman Irani""|""Vinod Chopra Films""|""Rajkumar Hirani Films""|""Fox Star Studios""|""ranbir kapoor sanjay dutt biopic""|""ranbir kapoor sanjay dutt biopic movie""|""ranbir kapoor sanjay dutt film""",0,16,2018,4,2018,4

Pictures http://readyplayeronemovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://twitter.com/readyplayerone\nhttp://instagram.com/readyplayerone\n\n-- \n\nFrom filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes the science fiction action adventure “Ready Player One,” based on Ernest Cline’s bestseller of the same name, which has become a worldwide phenomenon.  \n\nThe film is set in 2045, with the world on the brink of chaos and collapse.  But the people have found salvation in the OASIS, an expansive virtual reality universe created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance).  When Halliday dies, he leaves his immense fortune to the first person to find a digital Easter egg he has hidden somewhere in the OASIS, sparking a contest that grips the entire world.  When an unlikely young hero named Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) decides to join the contest, he is hurled into a breakneck, reality-bending treasure hunt through a fantastical universe of mystery, discovery and danger.\n\nSpielberg directed the film from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline.  The film was produced by Donald De Line, Spielberg, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Dan Farah; with Adam Somner, Daniel Lupi, Chris deFaria and Bruce Berman serving as executive producers.  \n\n“Ready Player One” stars Tye Sheridan (“X-Men: Apocalypse,” “Mud”), Olivia Cooke (“Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,” “Bates Motel”), Ben Mendelsohn (“Rogue One – A Star Wars Story,” “Bloodline”) and T.J. Miller (“Deadpool,” “Silicon Valley”), with Simon Pegg (the “Star Trek” movies, the “Mission: Impossible” movies) and Oscar winner Mark Rylance (“Bridge of Spies,” “Dunkirk”).  \n\nBehind the scenes, three-time Oscar winner Spielberg (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”) reunited his creative team from “Bridge of Spies,” including Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List,” “Saving Private Ryan”), Oscar-winning production designer Adam Stockhausen (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”), Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn (“Saving Private Ryan,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”) and Sarah Broshar (“The Post”), and costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone (“Moonrise Kingdom”).  The music is by Oscar-nominated composer Alan Silvestri (the “Back to the Future” films, “Forrest Gump”).\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and Amblin Entertainment present, in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, an Amblin Production, a De Line Pictures Production, a Steven Spielberg Film, “Ready Player One.”\n\nSlated for release on March 30, 2018, the film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

Directed by Nash Edgerton. In Theaters March 9.\n\nWatch the greenband trailer now: http://bit.ly/GringoOfficialTrailer\n\nAn exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth — or two steps ahead?\n\n#GringoMovie\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonVideoSubscribe\n» In Theaters March 9\n\nAbout Gringo:\nMild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J. Dix, Theron and Tambakis.\n\nOfficial Site  – www.gringo-movie.com  \n\nGet More from Amazon Studios: \nOfficial site: http://bit.ly/GetMoreAmazonStudios\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosInstagram\n\nAbout Amazon Studios:\nThe goal of Amazon Studios is to turn original stories into great entertainment.\n\nGringo - Official Redband Trailer [HD] | Amazon Studios\nhttps://youtu.be/MnKbM9Zxtn8\n\nAmazon Studios\nhttps://www.youtube.com/AmazonStudios  Amazon Studios|""Amazon""|""amazon prime""|""amazon video""|""original""|""trailer""|""episode""|""season""|""streaming""|""Amazon Original Series""|""Amazon instant video""|""Prime Video""|""Prime Instant Video""|""David Oyelowo""|""Charlize Theron""|""Joel Edgerton""|""Amanda Seyfried""|""Sharlto Copley""|""Thandie Newton""|""Paris Jackson""|""Harry Treadaway""|""Yul Vazquez""|""Nash Edgerton""|""STX Entertainment""|""STX Films""|""Gringo""|""Gringo Trailer""|""Gringo Charlize Theron""|""Gringo redband trailer""|""redband trailer""",4,104,2017,12,2017,12
24,59190,"""False""","""False""","Deadpool 2 Teaser Released - Movie Talk ColliderVideos On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday November 15th, 2017) Mark Ellis, Kristian Harloff, Jon Schnepp, Ashley Mova discuss the following: \n\n-First teaser released for Daedpool 2\n\n-Rotten Tomatoes Will Delay the Reveal of ‘Justice League’s Tomatometer Score\n\n-Tarantino’s next movie down to 3 studio front-runners Sony, Paramount and WB; Tom Cruise eyed for lead role\n\n-Animated Super Mario Bros. movie in development at Illumination and Universal\n\n-‘Halloween’ Reboot Timeline Confirmed by Danny McBride\n\n-What Women Want remake ‘What Men Want’ in the works at Paramount; Empire’s Taraji P. Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want.

2,362775,"""False""","""False""","The Crazy 5,000hp Devel Sixteen is REAL! | FIRST LOOK Shmee150 It may be crazy, but it's happening! Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150  Devel|""Sixteen""|""Devel Sixteen""|""Hypercar""|""Drag Racer""|""5000hp""|""Crazy""|""Fast""|""Ridiculous""|""Insane""|""Dubai""|""UAE""|""Motorshow""|""Launch""|""Premiere""|""Dubai Motorshow""|""DIMS""|""Exclusive""|""Introduction""|""Intro""|""V16""|""5000bhp""|""Fastest""|""Top Speed""|""Record""|""Shmee""|""Shmee150""",3,77,2017,11,2017,11

Not everything wows like gravitational waves or spacefaring sportscars. That’s the case with the recent discovery of earliest stars in the universe. In a Nature paper published a few weeks ago, Judd Bowman and collaborators report a signal from the very first stars to form in our universe. The same result also hints at brand new physics that may help explain the nature of dark matter. This result flew under the radar in part because it’s a subtle and clever result that requires a bit of interpretation. Today we’re doing a Space Time Journal Club to explain this discovery. We’ll follow that with the solution to our recent trebuchet challenge question.\n\nWritten and Hosted by Matt O'Dowd\nProduced by Rusty Ward\nGraphics by Grayson Blackmon\nAssistant Editing and Sound Design by Mike Petrow and Linda Huang\nMade by Kornhaber Brown (www.kornhaberbrown.com)\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon Big Bang, Quasar and Hypernova Supporters: \n\nBig Bang\nCoolAsCats\nDavid Nicklas\nFaisal Saud\nAnton Lifshits\nJoey Redner\n\nQuasar\nTambe Barsbay\nMayank M.

25,45118,"""False""","""False""","Parenting Habits That Could Keep Children From Succeeding In Life Business Insider Raising children requires good parenting techniques as well as avoiding bad habits.  A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Check out his website: http://wolfgangpuck.com/\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nSalmon with Pesto Veggie Noodles by Wolfgang Puck\nServings: 2\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 shallot\n2 cloves garlic\n5 large leaves basil\n¼ bunch flat leaf parsley\n1 pint cherry tomatoes\n1 teaspoon chili flakes\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n1 lemon\n¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking\n2 6-ounce fillets of salmon, skin off\n1 yellow squash\n1 zucchini\n2 carrots\n2 watermelon radishes\n\nPREPARATION\nFinely dice the shallot and add it to a medium bowl. \nMince the garlic and add it to the bowl with the shallot. \nChiffonade the basil, chop the parsley, and add to the bowl. \nQuarter the cherry tomatoes and add them to the bowl with the herbs, along with the chili flakes, a pinch of salt and pepper, the juice of one lemon, and the olive oil. Stir to combine.\nHeat a bit of oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. \nSeason the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. When the oil is shimmering, sear the salmon on one side until golden brown. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown and the fish is cooked through. Remove the salmon from the heat and wipe out the skillet.\nCut the squash, zucchini, carrots, and watermelon radishes in half, if needed, then spiralize.\nHeat a bit of oil in the pan over medium heat until simmering. \nAdd the vegetable noodles to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Saute until tender, about 2 minutes. \nDivide the vegetable noodles between two plates. \nPlace a piece of salmon on each bed of noodles, then top with tomato sauce.\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nWolfgang Puck's Trout in Puff Pastry\nServings: 6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n½ cup celery, sliced \n½ cup leeks, julienned\n½ cup carrots, julienned\nSalt, to taste\nWhite pepper, to taste\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 whole trout, cleaned\nBlack pepper, to taste\n2 tablespoons fresh tarragon, chopped\n2 sheets puff pastry\n2 eggs, beaten\nParsley, for serving\nLemon wedges, for serving\n\nChive Butter Sauce:\n1 cup white wine\nJuice of one lemon\n4 shallots, minced\n½ bunch tarragon \n1 cup heavy cream\n18 tablespoons (2 ¼ sticks) butter, sliced\nSalt, to taste\nPepper, to taste\n2 bunches chives, minced\n \nPREPARATION\nHeat the olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. \nAdd the celery, leeks, carrots, and a pinch of salt and white pepper, and sauté until the vegetables start to cook down. \nAdd the cream and stir to coat the vegetables. Cook until the cream is thickened.\nRemove the pan from the heat.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out both sheets of puff pastry until they are ⅓-inch thick. Transfer one sheet of puff pastry to the baking sheet.\nCut the trout along the back to remove the spine, then butterfly open. Season with salt, pepper, and the tarragon. \nScoop the cooked vegetables onto one side of the fish, then fold over the other fillet. \nTransfer the fish to the center of the sheet of puff pastry. \nBrush egg wash around the fish, then lay on the second sheet of puff pastry, pressing around the fish to seal. Use a paring knife to cut away the excess puff pastry in the shape of a fish. \nBrush the top of the puff pastry with egg wash and use the leftover pastry scraps to decorate the fish with an eye and gills. Use the tip of the knife or the large opening of a pastry tip to draw scales on the body and tail. \nChill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\nMake the Chive Butter Sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the wine, lemon juice, shallots, and tarragon. Reduce until only a ¼ cup of liquid remains. Add the cream and reduce until the mixture thickens slightly.\nSlowly whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, until the sauce is glossy and thickened. \nRemove the tarragon stem and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the chives.\nPreheat the oven to 375℉ (190℃). When the oven is heated.

Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. 
\n
\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.
\n
\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. 
\n
\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.
\n
\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. 
\n
\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.
\n
\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.
\n
\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.
\n
\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.
\n
\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/2zl7s34

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. \n\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly. Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment. Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer.

After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs.

Facing environmental disasters and a plunging birthrate, Gilead is ruled by a twisted fundamentalism in its militarized ‘return to traditional values'. As one of the few remaining fertile women, Offred (Elisabeth Moss) is a Handmaid in the Commander’s household, one of the caste of women forced into sexual servitude as a last desperate attempt to repopulate the world. In this terrifying society, Offred must navigate between Commanders, their cruel Wives, domestic Marthas, and her fellow Handmaids – where anyone could be a spy for Gilead – all with one goal: to survive and find the daughter that was taken from her.  hulu",1,30,2018,3,2018,3

Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush.

Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.See more from Wreck-It Ralph:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WreckItRalph/Twitter: https://twitter.com/wreckitralphInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wreckitralph/See more from official Disney Animation:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimationTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimationWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of diehard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.Sanju is in turns a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “did this really happen?” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani.

Our childhoods, even the apparently benign ones, leave us no option but to be anything else.\nAs a result of these childhoods, we tend, over most issues, to list – like a sailing yacht in high wind – far too much in one direction or another. We are too timid, or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating; too focused on material success or excessively lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily naive or sourly down to earth; we recoil from risk or embrace it recklessly; we have emerged into adult life determined never to rely on anyone or as desperate for another to complete us; we are overly intellectual or unduly resistant to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances is a volume without end. What is certain is that these imbalances come at a huge cost, rendering us less able to exploit our talents and opportunities, less able to lead satisfying lives and a great deal less fun to be around…”\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects on our blog, here: https://goo.gl/6ubziU\n\nMORE SCHOOL OF LIFE\n\nVisit us in person at our London HQ: https://goo.gl/qf1h3j\n\nWatch more films on SELF in our playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/TSOLself\n\nYou can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&tab=2 \nFind out how more here: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB \n\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFeel free to follow us at the links below:\n\nDownload our App: https://goo.gl/b7FNXL\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/  \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife   \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/ \n\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced in collaboration with:\n\nDirected by: Hannah & Martha \n\nDesign: Hannah McNally\n\nAnimation Team: Flora Caulton, Emily Downe, Martha Halliday, Hannah McNally, Kathrin Steinbacher \n\nwww.hannahandmartha.com\n\nwww.floracaulton.co.uk\n\nwww.emilydowne.co.uk\n\nwww.kathrinsteinbacher.com  the school of life|""alain de botton""|""philosophy""|""wellness""|""psychology""|""school of life""|""childhood""|""adulthood""|""childhood trauma and brain development""|""developmental disorders""|""why we are the way we are""|""PL-SELF""|""कैसे खराब हो जाता है बचपन आपको वयस्कता में प्रभावित कर सकता है""|""Cómo la infancia puede afectarlo en la edad adulta""|""Wie Kindheit dich im Erwachsenenalter beeinflussen kann""|""Comment l'enfance peut vous affecter à l'âge adulte""|""Como a infância pode afetá-lo como adulto""|""童年如何影响你作为一个成年人""",7,177,2018,3,2018,3

Reilly) and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of Sarah Silverman) must risk it all by traveling to the world wide web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, Sugar Rush. In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet—the netizens—to help navigate their way, including a webite entrepreneur named Yesss (voice of Taraji P. Henson), who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site “BuzzzTube.” Directed by Rich Moore (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph”) and Phil Johnston (co-writer “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Cedar Rapids,” co-writer “Zootopia,”), and produced by Clark Spencer (“Zootopia,” “Wreck-It Ralph,” “Bolt”), “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-Ralph 2” hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018.See more from Wreck-It Ralph:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WreckItRalph/Twitter: https://twitter.com/wreckitralphInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wreckitralph/See more from official Disney Animation:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyAnimationTwitter: https://twitter.com/disneyanimationWelcome to the official Walt Disney Animation Studios YouTube channel!

By February 28, Scooby was tearing down the tide at 45 miles an hour on his rattling surfboard. There was a 70-foot mountain of water avalanching behind him.\n\nThe seething spume nipped him from behind and sent him bombing into the fray in a violent back flop.\n\nScooby’s friend and fellow Brazilian, Lucas Chumbo Chianca, rode in on a jet ski to pick him up before the next monster set rolled in. Scooby grabbed ahold of a rear tow board latched to the jet ski, and they sped away in an attempt to outrun the next wave. Chumbo soon lost control in the choppy whitewater, and the jet ski capsized near some dangerous rocks. Another massive wave was right behind them. \nTwo people now needed a rescue. \nHow did Scooby and Chumbo finally escape the chaos?

Learning about my ancestry and discovering some of my taste preferences, and comparing them with my Dad, was fascinating. He and I both had a great time meeting and eating. We happen to be traveling in Ghana, and my Dad happened to be in Nairobi, Kenya for a few days having some meetings, so I thought it would be a perfect opportunity, to meet my Dad. Luckily it all worked out smoothly!Accra, GhanaWaakye - 8 GHC ($1.80) - Waakye is a popular Ghanaian food / meal, and that’s what we started the day with. You get rice and beans, a number of other starches, and some tomato sauce stew and meats, all piled high into a leaf bowl. It was delicious!Makola Market - Next we visited Makola Market, the largest and most energetic market in Accra. It’s a must visit, to see the energy and life at the market.The Accra Arts Center - Finally, we stopped off at the Accra Arts Center to buy a few things before leaving in at night.Accra to Nairobi - We had a late night flight, and we landed early at sunrise to cool Nairobi!After checking into a hotel just for 1 night, we took a quick hour nap, and then jumped into a taxi to go meet my Dad who was staying at a guesthouse.It was great to see my Dad and at the guesthouse we compared our ancestry and our taste preference. Then we went to go eat some Kenyan food, which was a highlight. Now do you know where I got my love for food from?Java House coffee - Finally, as you already know, I have a tendency to enjoy caffeine, and so does my Dad. So it was only right to stop for a cup of coffee to finish.Thank you for watching, and again, a big thank you to https://www.23andme.com/markwiens for sponsoring this video.MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Check out: https://www.23andme.com/markwiens  23andme|""Dad""|""Fathers Day""|""Ghana""|""Kenya""|""Ghana food""|""Kenyan food""|""Ghanaian food""|""waakye""|""Accra""|""Nairobi""|""Mark Wiens""|""street food""|""local food""|""food travel""|""travel guide""|""food""|""chapati""|""DNA""|""dna report""|""ancestry""",8,202,2018,6,2018,6

Mark Hamill's Opinion Of The Last Jedi - The John Campea Show John Campea On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Wednesday, December 27th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon!  http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nPATREON Supporter Spencer Smothers - Spencer Smothers - Hi John. You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you’re having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn’t good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i’m 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith.

Dragon will separate from Falcon 9’s second stage about 10 minutes after liftoff and attach to the space station on Wednesday, April 4.\n\nBoth Falcon 9 and the Dragon spacecraft for the CRS-14 mission are flight-proven. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the CRS-12 mission in August 2017 and Dragon previously supported the CRS-8 mission in April 2016.\n\nSpaceX will not attempt to recover Falcon 9’s first stage after launch.\n\nDragon will be filled with about 5,800 pounds of supplies, payloads and vehicle hardware, including critical materials to directly support science and research investigations that will occur onboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nSpaceX CRS-14 is the fourteenth of up to 20 missions to the International Space Station that SpaceX will fly for NASA under the first CRS contract. In January 2016, NASA announced that SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft were selected to resupply the space station through 2024 as part of a second Commercial Resupply Services contract award. Under the CRS contracts, SpaceX has restored an American capability to deliver and return significant amounts of cargo, including live plants and animals, to and from the orbiting laboratory. A variant of the Dragon spacecraft, called Crew Dragon, is being developed for U.S.- based crew transport to and from the space station.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 4 International Space Station crew members will use the station’s 57.7-foot (17.6-meter) robotic arm to reach out and capture the Dragon spacecraft and attach it to the orbiting laboratory.\n\nDragon will return to Earth with more than 3,900 pounds of cargo after an approximately one-month stay at the International Space Station. About five hours after Dragon leaves the space station, it will conduct its deorbit burn, which lasts up to 10 minutes. It takes about 30 minutes for Dragon to reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California.\n\nFor more information about the mission and payloads, visit www.nasa.gov/spacex.

22,3961163,"""False""","""False""","Primitive Technology: Lime Primitive Technology At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty. Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU or Skillcults channel: https://youtu.be/jOxaOTUGuKo). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a “lid” to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes “dead lime”, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It’s basically the ‘Glue’ that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages.

Today, music is an essential part of the sport and there’s a hidden strategy behind how they pick their songs. For a long time, figure skaters skated to classics like Carmen, Swan Lake, and Don Quixote. Not only because it’s great music but because of the clear story line and the dynamic characters in them. \n\nBut this is all changing. In 2014, the ISU changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. Now with a wider range of music to choose from — some skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for Lil Jon. Will this be a new era of figure skating?\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Simon's Cat has been made using a variety of animation software over the years. Originally in Adobe Flash. Then TV Paint (and still on occasions) and most recently using CelAction.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.  cartoon|""simons cat""|""simon's cat""|""simonscat""|""simon tofield""|""simon the cat""|""funny cats""|""cute cats""|""cat fails""|""family friendly""|""animated animals""|""short animation""|""animated cats""|""simon's katze""|""black and white""|""kitty""|""traditional animation""|""black and white cat""|""cat lovers""|""animal (film character)""|""fail""|""funny cat""|""cats""|""cute""|""kitten""|""kittens""|""pets""|""simons cats""|""Cat""|""Simon""|""Tofield""|""cartoons""|""Toons""|""Animated""|""Animation""|""Funny""|""Humour""|""fun""|""videos""|""кот саймона""|""crow""|""birds""|""cawing crow""|""peace""|""quiet""",15,371,2018,5,2018,6

Lettering is always a challenge to build in dominoes based off a picture because you have to be extremely precise to make the font look right (here's the original picture: http://bit.ly/2DylugC). Lots of proportions, measuring, and eye-balling were needed for this project. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get this to topple sequentially by letter, since everything was connected in cursive (however, sometimes not in the direction it needed to topple). I had to tape down a few one way dominoes to ensure that the path would keep going in the right direction. Overall, this was a fun project to do and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed building it :)\n\nWATCH MORE DOMINO VIDEOS HERE! 😊\n●YOUTUBERS in dominoes ➡️ http://bit.ly/2uRzTDf\n●My BEST domino projects ➡️ http://bit.ly/2swnIWN\n●Video games/movies in dominoes ➡️ http://bit.ly/2u8tZdx\n\nHey!

28,837457,"""False""","""False""","Why Is Caviar So Expensive? Tech Insider Caviar is one of the most expensive foods in the world. Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/  Tech Insider|""TI""|""Tech""|""Science""|""Innovation""|""Digital culture""|""Design""|""Technology""|""Caviar""|""Beluga sturgeon""|""fish""|""fish farming""|""harvesting""|""sturgeon""|""fishing""|""Acipenseridae""|""roe""|""salt-water""|""United States fish and Wildlife service""|""fish species""|""sturgeon species""|""arne ludwig""|""iucn""|""Sturgeon specialist group""|""red list""|""sturgeon egg""|""sturgeon population""|""caviar import""|""importing""|""California Caviar Company""|""Kaluga queen""|""roe harvest""|""egg harvest""|""MOTTRA caviar""",6,150,2018,2,2018,2

But rather than feed the fire of an old flame, Alvin Cailan is teaming up with YouTube legend Andrew Rea (Binging With Babish) to teach people how to make both of these iconic burgers at home. Better yet, they've devised the ultimate peace treaty: a Double Shack x Double-Double Animal-style Voltron burger. It's a moment in burger history you won't want to miss.  \n\nFirst We Feast's The Burger Show is a new web series that explores everything about modern burger culture—from the rise of Instagram-bait stunt burgers, to the enduring influence of regional styles—through the eyes of Eggslut chef, Alvin Cailan.

24,5329977,"""False""","""False""","The Grinch - Official Trailer (HD) Illumination The Grinch - Official Trailer\nIn Theaters November 9\nhttps://www.grinchmovie.com\n\n\nFor their eighth fully animated feature, Illumination and Universal Pictures present The Grinch, based on Dr. Seuss’ beloved holiday classic.  The Grinch tells the story of a cynical grump who goes on a mission to steal Christmas, only to have his heart changed by a young girl’s generous holiday spirit.  Funny, heartwarming and visually stunning, it’s a universal story about the spirit of Christmas and the indomitable power of optimism.\n \nAcademy Award® nominee Benedict Cumberbatch lends his voice to the infamous Grinch, who lives a solitary life inside a cave on Mt. Crumpet with only his loyal dog, Max, for company.  With a cave rigged with inventions and contraptions for his day-to-day needs, the Grinch only sees his neighbors in Who-ville when he runs out of food.\n \nEach year at Christmas they disrupt his tranquil solitude with their increasingly bigger, brighter and louder celebrations.  When the Whos declare they are going to make Christmas three times bigger this year, the Grinch realizes there is only one way for him to gain some peace and quiet: he must steal Christmas.  To do so, he decides he will pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh.\n \nMeanwhile, down in Who-ville, Cindy-Lou Who—a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer—plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.  As Christmas approaches, however, her good-natured scheme threatens to collide with the Grinch’s more nefarious one.  Will Cindy-Lou achieve her goal of finally meeting Santa Claus?  Will the Grinch succeed in silencing the Whos’ holiday cheer once and for all?\n \nFind out, Christmas season 2018.

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. When the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Stars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. Directed by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly.

28,86300,"""False""","""False""","Developing a Permanent Treatment for Lactose Intolerance Using Gene Therapy The Thought Emporium For more than half a decade I've suffered from lactose intolerance. If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

The fact really happened at the Rio de Prata Ecological Recanto (Jardim-MS) on February 02 and was recorded during the monitoring carried out by Waldemilson Vera.\n\nWhen it rains a lot, the Rio da Prata river runs of slower form, causing its damming, thus increasing the water level of the Olho D'Água river.\n\nDespite the flood, on the day the video was recorded the waters of the Olho D'Agua river remained crystal clear due to their conserved riparian forest and being inside a Private Reserve of the Natural Patrimony - PRNP, a type of Conservation Unit.\n\nThis was a rare episode, and by the end of the day the river had returned to its normal level.\n\nWe would like to inform that on this date the tour operated normally until the 1st stretch, which, although it is also above normal, all the tourists left satisfied because they experienced a different and special day in the attraction!

The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well.

The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. \n\nAfter those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more and found delicious salads and pickled chilies that blew my mouth off, they were so hot and spicy!\n\nAfter this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!\n\nAfter exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well!

We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.\n\nHere are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:\n\n1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square\n2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market\n3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market\n4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros\n5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER \n\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious street food as I can .

Rogen has entered into a lifetime deal to transfer full ownership of his personal autonomy to Netflix, Inc. \n\n“I have known Seth for many years” said senior Netflix Development Executive Jareth Chumley. “After a wrap party in late 2017, Seth approached me and said something like ‘Jesus Fucking Christ Jarbear, I would sell my soul for a fuckin enchilada right now.’ And so basically that was how the idea was born. In the end we settled on a price a little higher than a standard Chili’s To-Go entree, but I’ll be damned, not by that much.”\n\n“As a general rule, I don’t really ‘read’ anything before I sign it,” replied Rogen when asked about the deal, spilling some beer on his own head as he does the finger-symbol equivalent of air quotes. “That’s what Danny is for, he handles that for me, mostly,” gesturing toward an elderly man in a poncho sleeping on the couch behind him. “Hey Danny!” he shouts, unable to wake his senior contract advisor. “I really hope he didn’t fuck this up. He’s the reason that Zach and Miri Make a Porno exists.”\n\nSeth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity is the first project where Netflix was able to successfully extract comedy directly from the actor’s mind. It will stream April 6. While the remaining projects Rogen will be participating in have not yet been finalized, Netflix is considering a live-action Shrek remake, starring Rogen as both the titular character, as well as that character’s love interest Fiona. There will also be other tasks considered, including some off-camera roles such as “executive foot massager” and “Quentin’s back waxer”. “The world really is our oyster here,” said Netflix Chief Operations Officer Karen Shartwell. “There really isn’t anything on earth that we can’t make him do.”\n\nWatch Hilarity For Charity on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/80189646\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 117 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

It was actually his first ever time performing at the annual awards ceremony and let’s just say he did not disappoint. Looking handsome as ever in an all white suit, he absolutely crushed the performance of his stand-alone track ‘Terrified,’ off his nominated album ‘Awaken, My Love.’\nNot only did he melt our hearts with that voice, he then completely surprised us by bringing JD McCrary up on stage to sing with him. Who, also sung like an actual angel.\nTonight felt like a preview of what’s to come, since Donald Glover and JD will actually be starring in a movie together, as they both are set to be in the Live-Action Lion King film.  JD will be voicing Young Simba and Donald will be voicing older Simba. And after this performance, we completely understand the casting choice.  \nThis was definitely a big night for Childish Gambino. In case that performance wasn’t enough, his track ‘Redbone’ just won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nBut right now I wanna turn it over to you guys. What did you think of Childish Gambino’s performance? Let me know all your thoughts and feelings down in the comments below and when you’re done with that, click right over here for all the deets on Kendrick Lamar’s performance.

Why isn’t ‘Off to the Vet’ available in full on YouTube? A. ‘Off to the Vet’ film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon’s Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com\n\nQ. What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: \nhttp://www.shop.simonscat.com  cartoon|""simon's cat""|""simonscat""|""simon the cat""|""funny cats""|""cat fails""|""animated animals""|""short animation""|""animated cats""|""simon's katze""|""black and white""|""kitty""|""traditional animation""|""black and white cat""|""Кот Саймона""|""cat lovers""|""animal (film character)""|""fail""|""funny cat""|""cats""|""cute""|""kitten""|""kittens""|""pets""|""simons cats""|""Cat""|""Simon""|""Tofield""|""cartoons""|""Toons""|""Animated""|""Animation""|""Kitten""|""Funny""|""Humour""|""fun""|""videos""|""box""|""pizza""|""bird""|""dressing up""|""jack in the""|""pandora's""|""hilarious""|""flat pack""|""boxes""",0,7,2018,2,2018,2

But the plan still needs to pass the House, where it's already facing strong headwinds.\nThe deal would boost military and non-defense spending by $300 billion over the next two years as well as and more than $80 billion in disaster relief. About $160 billion would go to the Pentagon and about $128 billion would to non-defense programs. The agreement includes spending on a variety of other needs, including disaster aid to respond to recent natural disasters.

His violins are played by some of the top musicians in the world and sell for as much as $16 million. For centuries people have puzzled over what makes his violins so great and they are the most scientifically studied instruments in history. I spoke to two world class violinists who play Stradivarius violins as well as a violin-maker about what makes Stradivari so great.

This track delicately describes the woman’s frozen heart with SUNMI’s sensibility, who gets hurt by the lopsided relationship with the person she loves but tries to understand the person.   \n \n#SUNMI#선미#Heroine#주인공#Newrelease#MV#1theK#원더케이\n\n▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\n▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\n▶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc  Kpop|""1theK""|""원더케이""|""loen""|""로엔""|""뮤비""|""티져""|""MV""|""Teaser""|""신곡""|""new""|""song""|""한류""|""hallyu""|""ロエン""|""ミュージック""|""ミュージックビデオ""|""ケーポップ""|""韓国の歌""|""アイドル""|""韓流""|""韓国""|""아이돌""|""idol""|""Heroine""|""SUNMI""|""선미""|""주인공""|""가시나""|""Gashina""",0,15,2018,1,2018,1

22,116400,"""False""","""False""","How to Heat an Off Grid Log Cabin with Wood, Thermal Imaging Scan (infrared) My Self Reliance Testing the heat loss in my off grid log cabin, I use my infrared thermal imaging camera to take night time photos of the cabin while the wood stove is on, and then again the following morning when the fire is no longer burning. My woodburning stove is not the most efficient for primary heating, so I show exactly how it functions and what I can do to make it more efficient, saving wood and money in the process. It's interesting to see my dog, Cali the Golden Retriever, show up on the thermal image and how cool she is compared to the surrounding walls, table and bed that she's lying on.\nThe tiny house should be very easy to heat once the pointing (mortar) is done inside and out and I can use what I've learned on this log cabin to help me design and build the other structures on my wilderness homestead. Working and collecting firewood alone is challenging, so I want to maximize the efficiency of each building in order to make this long term off grid survival situation more economically feasible. If I can reduce the amount of fuel needed to heat each off grid building, I can provide all of the energy I need for free from the property. This is going to require the installation of rocket stove (rocket mass heater) to use the wood more efficiently.\nI have a few upcoming diy projects that this thermal scan technology will help with - the bread oven, the sauna, the workshop and the maple sugar shack.\n\nLinks to Products Used: \n\nSolar LED light bulb 15W \nhttp://amzn.to/2BQvSQ2 \n\n\nAgawa Canyon Boreal 21 Saw\nhttp://amzn.to/2BPV6OF\n\nCopper Fairy lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2BCmF0X\n\nSolar String Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2DvgU2n\n\n\nBanneton 12 round \nhttp://amzn.to/2ByxwsF\n\n Lodge Dutch Oven\nhttp://amzn.to/2kHuxDQ\n\nFlamen heat resistant gloves up to 500 degrees\nhttp://amzn.to/2l1mRMm\n\nRocksheat baking stone\n http://amzn.to/2kF6eql\n\nMora Knife\nhttp://amzn.to/2BOiv35\n\nLamp OiI\nhttp://amzn.to/2qz0nZ1 \n\nWall Lantern (candle lit)\nhttp://amzn.to/2Dpa0MK \n\nMoka Pot\nhttp://amzn.to/2DEomvO  Canada\nhttp://amzn.to/2ndmtw6  USA\n\nCanon 6D\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdaZjs\n\nDJI Mavic Pro\nhttp://amzn.to/2DHuJib\n\nBragg's Sprinkle\nhttp://amzn.to/2EdouzK\n\nTo see what I’m up to during the rest of the week, please follow me on my other online channels;\n\nWebsite: http://myselfreliance.com/\nFacebook – https://www.facebook.com/MySelfReliance/\nPersonal Facebook Page (Shawn James) – https://www.facebook.com/shawn.james.msr\nInstagram – https://www.instagram.com/myselfreliance/\n\nMailing Address:\nP.O.

The byproduct of that, of course, is dropping cards - again, and again, and again.\n\nToday, after 14 years... we still drop our cards all the time. Sure, we now drop our cards less frequently; but no matter how much better we’ve gotten, bending to the floor and repeatedly picking cards up covered in dust (and hair) never gets any less frustrating. \n\nOver the years, we’ve come to establish a bit of a love-hate relationship with failure. We still don’t like it, yet we’ve also come to recognize that if we’re not dropping our cards enough, we’re also not going to get any better at Cardistry. And in that sense, we’ve come to find failure rather beautiful. \n\nRISE was birthed from a vision of ours to capture this intriguing beauty of failure.\n\nEnvisioning a juxtaposition between clean forms and abstract swirls, we pictured cards being manipulated with impeccable technique - abruptly interrupted and exploding out of the very hands that shuffled them. \n\nWe imagined them rising from the ground; the cards fluttering through the air in slow motion, dancing like the leaves in the Fall... and returning to our hands - perhaps forming imperfectly at first, then progressing with each step taken, and finally, displayed in all their glory. \n\nYet our stubbornness as Cardists doubling as filmmakers resulted in a few interesting restrictions that we imposed upon ourselves: \n\nIf this “Fall” vision were to be captured, it would have to be done with no CG. Everything had to be filmed in-camera and performed by ourselves with with a real deck of cards.\n\nNext, there would be no use of green screen, compositing, or other camera trickery. The furthest we agreed upon was the reversal of several scenes - and only if they genuinely added to the story we wanted to tell. \n\nAnd finally, the cards used could not be gimmicked in anyway - no strings, magnets or anything of the sort. If what we envisioned could not be accomplished by our technique, then the idea was scrapped. \n\nThankfully, after months of planning, testing, and of course...failing, we finally had the opportunity to transform our vision into a reality. \n\nThrough the use of a Phantom high-speed camera mounted on a Bolt Cinebot (thank you Shooting Gallery Asia), and the help of a leaf blower or two... Rise was born. \n\nWe truly hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it for you. \n\n- The Virts\n\n---\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck\nCredits:\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nCardistry Credits:\nCardistry performed by Virtuoso (The Virts):\nHuron Low \nKevin Ho \nDaren Yeow\n\nCardistry and Card flourish move list (in order shown):\n \nIndice Fans (classic)\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nStairmaster by Kevin Ho (credit to Birger Karlsson and Kenneth Aidan Foo)\nNinja Spring Grab + Replacement by Virtuoso\nFlicker by Huron Low  + Rev 2 Twirl by Daren Yeow\nFlicker Shot Behind the Back by Huron Low\nV Cascade by Daren Yeow\nAerial Combo Sequence by Huron Low (Kick Cut Flip, V Flip, by Huron Low, Railslide Flip, Aerial Cut by Dan and Dave Buck)\nBuzzsaw by Brendan Conner\nAnaconda by Bone Ho\nMind Eraser by Kevin Ho (credit to Chris Kenner and Huron Low)\nSatellite by Kevin Ho\nTornado Deck Split by Kevin Ho (credit to Bone Ho)\nPiano Cuts by Andrew Avila\nYo! variation by Daren Yeow (credit to Lee Asher)\nWaterwheel by Huron Low, Daren Yeow, and Elijah Cai\nIndice Fans (classic)\n\nVideo credits:\nDirector: Huron Low of Virtuoso\nDirector of Photography: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nVideo Editor: Daren Yeow of Virtuoso\nLighting by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nColor Grading by: Jeremy Tan of Virtuoso\nCrew: The Shooting Gallery Asia\nWardrobe Styling by: Shu Juang\n\nMusic Credits:\nMusic: Rise by Virtuoso \nMusic composed and produced by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio Post and Sound Design by: Roland Lim of Virtuoso\nAudio samples from Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins \n\nSpecial Thanks to:\nThe Shooting Gallery Asia: Seb Tan and his amazing team (shout out to Ahmad Rafa'ie!) for making this #Cardistry shoot possible. \nhttps://www.shootinggalleryasia.com/\n\nRISE feat. the FW17 Virtuoso deck by #thevirts\nhttps://youtu.be/S7kG641iA_g\n\nThe new FW17 Virtuoso deck is launching soon. \nLearn more about this deck and Cardistry at https://thevirts.com/  virtuoso|""thevirts""|""huron""|""daren""|""magic""|""flourish""|""cards""|""free""|""tutorial""|""trick""|""revealed""|""best""|""ellusionist""|""theory11""|""card""|""flourishes""|""cardistry""|""Card Trick""|""Card Flourish""|""cardistry tutorial""|""launch edition""|""penguin magic""|""card flourishes""|""kevin ho""|""daren yeow""|""huron low""|""spring summer""|""playing cards""|""waterwheel""|""anaconda""|""tricks""|""dan and dave""|""the virts""|""dealersgrip""|""learn cardistry""|""fontaine deck""|""fontaine cards""|""cardistry tutorials""|""cardistry for beginners""|""fw17""|""Liquid paper""|""fw17 virt""",4,103,2017,12,2017,12

Tech support, troubleshoot, cant help me because i didnt buy insurance, said i still would have to pay $75 for a replacement even with insurance(even if they sold me a lemon phone that was less than a month old) told me to go to a sprint store to see if they could help.\n-went to sprint store , waited 45 min , repair tech troubleshoot phone ,phone still not responding. \n-tech checks my account status to see what they could do, said i didnt have insurance so they couldnt do an exchange. Mentioned again i would have to pay $75 even if i had insurance and i still would have to wait for a replacement to come in which is most likely a refurbished device.\n- screw it so i sent it to samsung.\n- 3 weeks later got a refurbished phone with light scratches.\n-phone battery drains faster than usual,  apps freezing and crashing. \n-outcome of the situation... i paid full price for a used phone.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n@ 2:32 you can see the flash/line i was referring to.\n\n**UPDATE 12/24/2017\nI finally got the phone back. looks like I got back a refurbished phone. link below is to my other video / unboxing of the note 8.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6z0Nt0VyseM\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCompletely drained my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Battery.

Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. 
\n
\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.
\n
\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. 
\n
\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.
\n
\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. 
\n
\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.
\n
\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.
\n
\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.
\n
\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.
\n
\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/2zl7s34

Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna—now Dee Rock—embraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.\n\nThe film also stars Gillian Jacobs (“Don’t Think Twice,” “Love,” “Community”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids,” “Sisters”), Julie Bowen (“Modern Family”), Matt Walsh (“Veep,” “Ghostbusters”), Molly Gordon (“Love the Coopers,” “Animal Kingdom”), with Stephen Root (“Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Animal Kingdom”), Jessie Ennis (“Better Call Saul”), Adria Arjona (“True Detective,” “Emerald City”), Debby Ryan (“Jessie”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”).\n\nMcCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day. Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers.\n\nFalcone’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Julio Macat (“The Boss,” “Horrible Bosses 2,” “Daddy’s Home”); production designer Rusty Smith (“The Boss”); editor Brian Olds (“Central Intelligence”); and costume designer Louise Mingenbach (the “The Hangover” films).

Watch the new trailer for #CrazyRichAsians, only in theaters this August.\n—\nCRAZY RICH ASIANS follows native New Yorker Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) as she accompanies her longtime boyfriend, Nick Young (Henry Golding), to his best friend’s wedding in Singapore. Excited about visiting Asia for the first time but nervous about meeting Nick’s family, Rachel is unprepared to learn that Nick has neglected to mention a few key details about his life. It turns out that he is not only the scion of one of the country’s wealthiest families but also one of its most sought-after bachelors. Being on Nick’s arm puts a target on Rachel’s back, with jealous socialites and, worse, Nick’s own disapproving mother (Michelle Yeoh) taking aim. And it soon becomes clear that while money can’t buy love, it can definitely complicate things.\n \nDirected by Jon M. Chu (“Now You See Me 2”)  and based on the acclaimed worldwide bestseller by Kevin Kwan, the film features an international cast of stars, led by Constance Wu (“Fresh Off the Boat”); Henry Golding, making his feature film debut; Gemma Chan (“Humans”); Lisa Lu (“2012”); and Awkwafina (upcoming “Ocean’s 8,” “Neighbors 2”); with Ken Jeong (the “Hangover” films”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Star Trek: Discovery,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”).  The large starring ensemble also includes Sonoya Mizuno (“La La Land”), Chris Pang (“Marco Polo”), Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”), comedian Ronny Chieng (“The Daily Show”), Remi Hii (“Marco Polo”), Nico Santos (“Superstore”) and Jing Lusi (“Stan Lee’s Lucky Man”).\n \nColor Force’s Nina Jacobson (“The Hunger Games” films) and Brad Simpson (“World War Z”), and Ivanhoe’s John Penotti (“Hell or High Water”) produced the film, with Tim Coddington, Robert Friedland, Sidney Kimmel and Kevin Kwan serving as executive producers.  The screenplay is by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim, based on the novel by Kwan.\n—\nFollow #CrazyRichAsians on social media:\nhttp://www.crazyrichasiansmovie.com\nhttp://facebook.com/crazyrichasiansmovie\nhttp://twitter.com/crazyrichmovie\nhttp://instagram.com/crazyrichasians  Crazy Rich Asians|""Crazy Rich Asians Movie""|""Trailer""|""Official Trailer""|""Movie Trailer""|""Constance Wu""|""Henry Golding""|""Michelle Yeoh""|""Ken Jeong""|""Awkwafina""|""Gemma Chan""|""John M.

15,1735050,"""False""","""False""","Rescue of a Scared Homeless Dog with a Broken Heart Howl Of A Dog Rescue of scared homeless dog, heartbroken and sad, living on the cold streets. This sweet old dog was found roaming near a railroad station. It was too risky to attempt a rescue there, we were worried that he could run and get hit by a passing train, so we followed him, trying to redirect him towards a safer place. It was quite a marathon as he ran away each time we approached him. But he eventually understood we are only trying to help him, or maybe the smell of the yummy treats finally reached his nose. He was limping and we also noticed a scar near his left eye so we took him straight to the veterinary clinic. When we scanned him for a microchip we discovered that he had an owner! We hoped a happy dog-owner reunion would follow, but when we contacted the registered owner he told us he does not want the dog back and asked us to take him. Apparently, Bobi (this is the name given by his owner) ran away from home and traveled quite a long distance, being found approximately 10 miles away from his home. We’ll never know why he left home and why he wasn’t wanted anymore, but we do not want to judge anyone, we’re just thankful that we were able to save him.\nBobi is 9 years old, medium sized, approximately 18 kg (39 lbs), fully vaccinated, microchipped, neutered. His vision is completely lost in the left eye, an old scar located near the eye indicates that he had been injured there, possibly hit, so that’s how he lost his sight in that eye. But the good news is that vision in the right eye is not affected and he sees well with it. \nHe’s very gentle, loving and obedient and he is still playful and curious. It's like he's living now the puppyhood he missed. \nBobi is an old dog in his golden years and he needs a caring adoptive family to offer him a home, a FOREVER home this time, where he can spend his remaining years happy and loved. He is in Howl Of A Dog’s care in Romania, but please note that we also allow international adoptions and he can travel to the USA, Canada or Europe. \nTo adopt Bobi please check our adoption procedure: www.howlofadog.org/adoption-procedure/ or send us an email on contact@howlofadog.org.

Newly single and nearly divorced, Scheana finds herself at the center of the SUR gossip when rumors about her new relationship begin to swirl. Ariana and Tom face one of the biggest fights of their relationship, as Tom’s loyal dedication to his friends makes Ariana feel like an afterthought. When Lala convinces Lisa to give her one last chance at SUR, the former outcast finds herself in an unlikely new role of peacekeeper, which complicates her friendship with James as he deals with a shocking rumor about his sex-life. Stassi tries to salvage her four-year relationship with Patrick, while Kristen devotes her energy to breaking up Jax and Brittany rather than focusing on her own relationship.

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \nhttps://goo.gl/XHYuvv \nhttps://goo.gl/BVJWmY\n\nRead the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\nhttps://goo.gl/ydYx1R\n\nRead the NAS report on driving fatigue:\nhttps://goo.gl/VJVZMa\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Push notifications buzz in your pocket, red bubbles demand attention, and endless distractions sit at your fingertips. It can feel impossible to pull away from. But that’s kind of the point. When people talk about the “attention economy,” they’re referring to the fact that your time and attention are the currency on which today’s applications make money. Because apps profit off of the total time you spend on their platform, there’s a strong incentive to use psychological tricks  to keep you endlessly hooked. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Tristan Harris, who runs Time Well Spent, is working to create a world where platforms can more honestly respect their users’ time. \n\nBy Design is a new Vox video series about the intersection of design and technology, hosted by Christophe Haubursin.

Pictures In Theaters April 20, 2018\n\nwww.RampageTheMovie.com\nwww.facebook.com/RampageTheMovie\nwww.twitter.com/RampageTheMovie\nwww.instagram.com/RampageTheMovie\n\n--\n\nGlobal megastar Dwayne Johnson headlines the action adventure “Rampage,” directed by Brad Peyton.  \n\nPrimatologist Davis Okoye (Johnson), a man who keeps people at a distance, shares an unshakable bond with George, the extraordinarily intelligent, silverback gorilla who has been in his care since birth.  But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\n\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros.

It might be a bit overkill but it's probably easier than searching specifically for soft water.\n** Add more nigari or lemon juice if necessary\n\n－Sukiyaki Sauce－\n100ml sake\n100ml mirin\n100ml soy sauce\n30g granulated sugar\n\n－Vegetables－\nYou can use any vegetables you like. Here'are the ones I used this time\n\ngreen onion\nChinese cabbage\nshiitake mushroom\ncarrot\nthread konjac\nvery thin, marbled beef slices\n \n\n \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-Tofu-\n1. Soak the soybeans in water(1200ml). The soaking time depends on the water temperature. \n\nSummer: 25°C/77°F 10 hours\nSpring, Autumn: 15°C/59°F 20 hours\nWinter: 5°C/41°F 30 hours\n\n2. Blend the soybeans and water in a mixer to make namago. (Namago is the Japanese word for that specific blended mixture of soybeans and water).\n3. Boil 1600ml water in a large pan or pot and add the namago and stir for about 10 minutes. Make sure not to burn the namago at the bottom of the pan.\n4. Turn off the heat and strain the namago with a filter cloth to get soy milk. The leftover is called okara and it's very healthy. I normally use it for making cookies. \n5. Mix 20ml nigari (or lemon juice) and 50ml water together to make the coagulant for the soy milk.\n\n(Your coagulant is a substance that will curdle the soy milk. You can use acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, or salt. Nigari, which is magnesium chloride, is popular in Japan, and calcium chloride is popular in North America.\n-huffingtonpost)\n\n6. Heat up the soy milk and keep the temperature at 75°C. Add the nigari-water and stir gently. Do NOT mix too much.  Turn off the heat and leave it for about 10 minutes.\n7. While resting the soy milk, prepare a container for shaping the tofu. You can make holes in the bottom of a paper drink carton or tupperware, or you can just use your filter cloth and tie it up tighly to shapen the tofu as well.\n\n-Sukiyaki Sauce-\n\n1. Add 100ml sake and 100ml mirin in a pot and boil it.\n2. Add the sugar and soy sauce, and let the sugar melt.\n\n-Sukiyaki-\n1. Melt the beef fat* (or just some slices of fatty beef) and cook the green onion (if you have it) in the sukiyaki pot to add flavor to the sauce. Green onion tastes so much sweeter and more flavorful when you fry it first. \n2. Add the sauce and heat it up. Then add tofu, konjac, mushrooms, and anything that takes longer to cook than your other vegetables.\n3. Finally, place everything else.\n\nSukiyaki is a shared Japanese dish where everyone ladles out some of the broth and food into their own bowls. Traditionally, sukiyaki is eaten with a raw beaten egg added to your own bowl, but that might be difficult for you depending on how safe raw eggs are considered where you live. I normally don't eat it with egg so I can enjoy the flavor of beef and vegetables, but if you get a chance to eat sukiyaki, please give it a try!\n\n*In Japan when you buy beef there is usually a bucket nearby where you can also take a cube of beef fat free of charge. If you want you can buy this separately, or you can use beef that has fat on it as well.  cook|""cat""|""Jun""|""Rachel""|""Japanese""|""food""|""cuisine""|""sukiyaki""|""knife""|""recipe""|""cooking""|""kitchen""|""junskitchen""|""Japan""|""日本""|""料理""|""すき焼き""|""作ってみた""|""猫""|""ねこ""|""ぬこ""|""英語""|""海外""|""ジュン""|""日本人""|""アメリカ""|""外国""|""英会話""|""yt:cc=on""|""nabe""|""dish""",8,204,2018,2,2018,2

Watch the OFFICIAL TRAILER for Trust, FX’s new series from Academy Award winners Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson. Premieres March 25th.\n\nSubscribe now for more Trust clips: http://bit.ly/SubscribeFX \n\nTrust delves into the trials and triumphs of one of America’s wealthiest and unhappiest families, the Gettys. Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and an examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.  \n\nTold over multiple seasons and spanning the twentieth century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson), an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldn’t pay for the return of a loved one? \nPaul’s grandfather, J. Paul Getty (Donald Sutherland), an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. He’s busy. Paul’s father, J. Paul Getty Jr. (Michael Esper), is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paul’s mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, she’s broke. Trust charts the teenage grandson’s nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.\n\nThe cast also includes Brendan Fraser, Anna Chancellor, Norbert Leo Butz, Charlotte Riley and Luca Marinelli.\n\nTrust is created by Simon Beaufoy. Danny Boyle has directed the first three episodes. Executive Producers are Christian Colson, Beaufoy and Boyle. The show is produced by FX Productions, Cloud Eight Films, Decibel Films and Snicket Films Limited.\n\nTrust | Season 1: Official Trailer [HD] | FX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/FXNetworks  Trust|""getty""|""kidnapping""|""family drama""|""soap""|""crime""|""power""|""money""|""tv series""|""FX Networks""",5,126,2018,1,2018,1
